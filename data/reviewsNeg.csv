I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying ""x large pizza and large salad only 23$"". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied. 

To the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively. 

And your salads are severely overpriced

Service was excellent, and highly attentive.
Food, absolutely horrible.

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. 
What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. 
What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. 
Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet
Veggies, blah.
Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. 

In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. 

I've had it with this place.
If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle",review,iwUN95LIaEr75TZE_JC6bg,0,4,3

I just can't believe the things that happened!!

Yes the app was good.  The entree was good too, but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini.  It definitely would have been better with more chicken!

But the girl working here is one of the worst waitress/bartender/hostesses EVER!

When we walked in, she didn't even sit us.  We stood there forever waiting until she finally told us to seat ourselves.  We went outside since there was nothing left inside.  It was too hot outside so we came back in and figured we'd sit at the bar.  Luckily a nice guy noticed us looking around and let us sit at the end of his table that he moved apart since his whole party didn't show up for dinner.

I was so excited when I saw they had cider on their menu!  And not just one, but two that I like!  Wyder's Pear Cider and Strongbow!!  
I ordered a Wyder's.  After I finished it and asked for another, she said they were out of them.  Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake!

When we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever.

When she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better.",review,UL9chyH0a4Pj8J_9M6WSpA,1,2,2

La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person!

my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone ""name please?"", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to ""fit us in"". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.

anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could ""squeeze in"" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,""coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?"". 

the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.

this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.",review,HY9qpAamqLXFoa7xMwNntg,1,1,3

Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection. 

I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .  

My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.  

Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.

The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich. 

What I had:
Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton.

I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was ""anythings good.""

However, I was very dissapointed with the service I received.  I'll type the one sarcastic comment that I can't get out of my head and then I'll get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED.

Here are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome.

On to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!

Then, those of us who actually purchased books and were trying to peacefully read them were in the cafe' - sitting on their dirty wooden benches - where I guess the servers there think that part of theirs jobs in serving coffee is to do a drum solo every time they empty the used coffee grinds into the trash can - which was about every 5 minutes. Yeesh! Luckily, I had my iPod. It was blasting and I still could hear them banging away. It was not a very cleanly area either. 

I was going to ask if they had wifi but I just high-tailed it out of there instead. This place is small too and their book selection is limited.

In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. 

The service was OK, but not great. There was only one other table in there, and the waitress seemed to forget things, and when we asked her about the meals, I felt like she was giving us canned answers of ""everything is good, just order something so I can go home"". Admittedly it was about 30 or 45 minutes before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it. 

It wasn't a BAD meal by any means. It accomplished the goal of providing nourishment, and was better than bringing mickey D's back to the hotel room, but I won't be going back. The yelp definition of 2 stars is ""Meh. I've experienced better"", and I think that description fits my meal perfectly.",review,-V3CXSxnUzjkLVqi1xGrkA,0,0,0

Great spot for a late-afternoon glass of wine with an appetizer. Mostly poor execution from kitchen, excellent service.

--crispy plantains with pepper are tasty and fun, crab dipping sauce, not enough crab
--tuna salad with arugula, uninteresting
--side salad for ciabatta ""sandwich"" typical Dole bag mix (first visit) was WILTED and nasty. Shame!
--chicken salad with dried tomatoes and goat cheese; way too much cheese

Working with machine-made ice (you know, the stuff with all the flecks and shards that water down a proper martini), she primed the ice with a squeeze of lemon, drained, then prepped the glass with vermouth, in and out, then pour the STIRRED Sapphire in, drop twist!

Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. 

The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say ""sacrificed or as important"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). 

The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, ""don't wear pants,"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly ""cooler"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? 

The answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. 

Hate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.",review,80PHOfM8KOBb7xEQN4C0lg,0,0,0

I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  
When paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.

I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home, froze two and cooked one. It smelled, but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.

I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.

Well, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.

And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.

They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! 

I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty ""I don't care"" attitude.

I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!

The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the ""questionable meat"" instead of throwing it out!

Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?

So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. 

Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities.

I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.

The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.

Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.

Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.

Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.

Okonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat

Tako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily

The ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.

First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.

Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.

Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.

Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   

Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.
No value

Food:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.
My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.

Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.

Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!",review,zNR8Q6Fw9UvlVSgxwEy-3Q,3,10,1

As a Starter we had the Spinach Quesadilla made with Lavosh and it was great. I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone I'd go back.

My better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat.

THE GOOD: 
* Great Sindhi biryani - the rice is flavorful, the chicken is tasty, all in all a great dish. 
* Chicken boti tikka (boneless pieces of marinated chicken grilled in a clay oven) - also tasty, but have had better elsewhere
* Naan - Really good stuff. Crisp and soft in all the right places - exactly how it should be made. Better than 95% of other Indo-Pakistani places in the Valley.

THE BAD:
* Chintzy interior which seemed like you just warped yourself straight back to the Punjab somewhere, complete with water-stained panels on the ceiling. 99.99% of the time, this doesn't faze me at all, but something was a little off and I don't know why.
* A surly ""aunty type"" who's standing behind the register and doesn't even want to greet you unless you're apparently related to her or go to school with her kids
* Said ""aunty type"" disappears into the kitchen for 5 minutes at a time, so you stand around and wait. And wait.
* Said ""aunty type"" expresses nonverbal displeasure when you ask her for anything. Case in point: Asking her for tamarind chutney. Even though you waited for your food for 30 minutes.
* Said ""aunty type"" brings back a tiny plastic cup of goopy, thick tamarind paste. Huh?
* Said ""aunty type"" doesn't say ""thank you"", smile, or anything when you go up to pay, even though you've been nothing but friendly and appreciative. So much for engaging a potential repeat customer. She could care less about your patronage.

THE UGLY:
* Big screen TV tuned to some badly acted Indian soap opera about some ancient king of Sri Lanka who tries to get it on with his handmaidens while his brother schemes for the throne while twisting one end of his moustache, but then switched to another channel showing bad, unknown songs from 4th-tier mid-90's Bollywood movies. Although I am not kidding you...there was one video where a guy and a girl were doing their running around and singing thing....in the SWISS ALPS. And then, all of a sudden, in the middle of all that snow, a table appears full of Indian food and an umbrella advertising beer and pretzels. WTF? 

So, in the end, here's the equation:

First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine.

it hurts my lungs to breath.

I couldn't get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay.
The problem is... *i DON'T OWN A CAR, I don't drive, I don't even have a drivers license*!!
~*~*-- aside from that one minor incident,~*~*

I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education.
I graduated with a magna cum laude. I have attended other universities. However, I couldn't help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered.

For example, you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes.

Business school was so and so, a lot of repetition.
Very little hands-on and help with internships.
Way too much groupwork and free-riding.
They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events.

Oh, and professors rarely teach the courses.
They have their teaching assistants teach us.

Also, there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes.
 Junior year when you get admitted into the ""professional program"" the level of the classes and transition isn't too smooth.

The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if you're having trouble with classes (usually lower level)

There are not enough chairs/desks in some classes.
The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls.

Also, the classes don't teach you how to think critically, which I think is crucial in college.
Please don't waste your money, especially those of you from out of state. Its not worth it.

Expect to wait in line wherever you go.
ASU accepts way too many people.
It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.

Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need.
The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school.
They are not informed enough to advise you.

I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration.
I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.

Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007.
Gross!!

One thing I liked was the student theatre performances. The admission $ was reasonable and quite entertaining.

The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security.

ASU is not the most safe neighborhood.
I have been approached by many shady people.

do NOT live on campus. Especially the dorms on north campus.
They are beyond crappy and overpriced.
You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads.
The ""freshman year experience"" bullsh*t they pull on you, don't buy it.
and Please PLEASE please don't move into Manzy Hall (Manzanita; 15 stores with triangular windows).

I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest (rats), unhealthy (mold, pot circulation), most promiscuous place on campus.

Again, please don't bother wasting your money, especially if your an out of state or international student.

When my pear omelet with potatoes arrived, it brought mixed reactions. The omelet itself was served hot, and loaded with bacon and cheese.  The potatoes served alongside were STILL FROZEN in the middle.   We were unable to catch the attention of the hectic servers to get this corrected. When I brought my plate to the bartender, he poked the potatoes with his fingers, and then asked me if it would be OK if he kept the same omelet, but ""throw some fresh potatoes"" on the plate.  The server said that, if the kitchen had to remake the omelet, there could be a long delay. 

I could only respond with a shrug. He left and went to the kitchen with my plate. Several other people touched and poked the plate and potatoes before replacing them.  He then brought the plate back to me at the bar, and not my table.

The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner.  

Dottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about.  

I've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much.

Because it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.  I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a person's body which stops me from eating it).

The two things that make this place worth going for are the margaritas and the service.  The margaritas are 50% tequila and fabulous- I usually just stick to the house margarita and am satisfied.  The people that work at Barrio are friendly and cool.  I imagine that they all enjoy working there.

But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.

Occasionally, I have stopped into Mill's End for breakfast, specifically because they have crepes on their menu; in fact, their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe.  For reasons explained below, lately I've found myself just walking past Mill's End, no longer considering giving it my business.  The general issues that I have with this place involve just a couple of basic things; if the owners made the effort to correct these, I believe Mill's End could be a great cafe.

I have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors.  It is with all three of these that Mill's End falls short: 

1)Ambience.  This means that the environment must be suitable both for studying/reading, as well as relaxation.  So, the music playing needs to be something that is non-intrusive and that the customers can generally ignore; sometimes Mill's End has this covered, but other times not at all.  Onto the seating.  It seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995, in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the TV show ""Friends;"" unfortunately, they didn't come close, but there is usually plenty of seating open.  By the way, what is up with pseudo-sexual ice photography on the walls?

2)Price.  This is actually my number one problem with Mill's End.  The coffee is reasonably priced, but the food is too expensive.  Anytime I tell someone that I ate there, it's always the same response, ""yeah, their food is good, but it's really pricey.""  Considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop, I imagine that their business has gone up, but those prices sure haven't dropped.

3.Customer service.  The staff has always been just lukewarm.  Look, I don't expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time, I only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality; this has just always been kind of lacking at Mill's End.

Our first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. 

We decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? 

So that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.

As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying ""seat yourself"". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say.

We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. 

After an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The ""quinoa crust"" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.

We also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made ""extra spicy"" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.",review,2qnz2y_Z1nDo2HqqfxJxSA,0,0,0

I couldn't see her headset so I thought she was speaking to me, but obviously she wasn't. In fact, she never looked at me during the lightning fast manicure, except in confusion when I said I didn't want her to cut my cuticles -- just push them back. She really didn't understand that, and asked me in broken English why I was getting a manicure but not getting my cuticles cut. She didn't have an attitude about it, but was just really confused. I think after that exchange, she told whoever was on her phone about it.

Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.

The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it. 

Lettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes

Bottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client.

I have been to this location a couple of times. My friends LOVE this place, and I really wanted to at least like it. But here I sit typing out my review and fighting the urge to double over the trash can at my desk. I can't remember the last time I felt so sick! 

A few things about last night's dinner stand out...as negative. But I'll start with the positive, which bumped the review up from 1 star to 2. 

POSITIVE: 

Our waitress was very friendly and chipper. 

NEGATIVE: 

But alas, it was not enough. We ordered edamame, 4 rolls and a couple of sake bombers...um...but the ""shot glass"" was too big to fit in the glass...so that no worky. 

The waitress asked if we wanted everything to come at once or if she should bring them out as they were prepared...we chose the latter... 

1) we never got our edamame, 

2) it took 30 minutes before the first roll came out (with no wasabi or ginger??), the next 2 rolls took an additional 30 minutes, and the 4th roll was about 5-10 minutes after that... 

3) the spicy yellowtail (roll #3) had obviously turned, it smelled like bad fish, which I unfortunately didn't realize until it had already made it's way into my mouth...I felt instantly sick and haven't been right since then, which means I didn't even get to enjoy a taste of the 4th roll because I didn't trust it anymore. 

POSITIVE: 

She took the yellowtail off our bill...which seems like it would be a no-brainer, but you never know these days. 

NEGATIVE: 

No apology for serving us bad fish, and no acknowledgment from the mgr on duty, which should be standard operating procedure at a restaurant. 

Also, the acoustics are not conducive to having any sort of conversation. The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud. 

And finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement. It's set up in a way so that you are rubbing elbows with other parties and unable to avoid being all up in their kool-aid... 

POSITIVE:

We got 4 plates which consisted of 4 individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top.

Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...

- The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.

- This place is a disorganized mess. 

- There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.

I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said ""NO"" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word ""water"") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.

I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!"" 

I said ""It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion."" (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)

The smashfries were good but they were greasy as well. I'm not expecting for my burger to be dry but there is a major difference between juicy and greasy and they crossed over into the land of the grease. And they were heavy handed with the salt. Unless I want my sodium intake for the week in 1 day, I would suggest that they move away from the salt.

They are similar to Five Guys in that they have no combos but they have more options. I can see what the appeal is and maybe the cook was having a bad day but between the grease and the salt I will not be going back unless I have a death wish.",review,K5oJ9aQth_Ltg3Awgjy-wA,0,2,0

So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.  

Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.

Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( 

Entrees.

Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) 

Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. 

Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.

Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: 

Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.

Short Review:

THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS

Long Review:
We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall. 

The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night. 

The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!

The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a ""sports cafe""?? 

The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the ""line"" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos!

If any of this appeals to you this is your place!

Pull in and i tell the guy i want the ""Signature"" change which includes window wash and floor vacuum, mentioning my $5 off coupon. He said that they were already running a special that was $13 off the $35 price so i said a-ok, cowboy. 

i wait for about 8-10 minutes in the small waiting room (bonus for having a Phoenix Magazine in the stack of Muscle Car Monthly, Oil Today and Antennas Weekly - look, just because i'm getting routine maintenance on my car does not mean i'm INTO cars).

I get pulled into the garage area for the ""spiel"" everybody dreads but it was surprisingly short and non-pushy. (i'm glad they don't drag you over to your engine anymore, that's totally lame). i do have to note that he tried to tell me my right front blinker, my left back blinker and my license plate lights were out. i had JUST gone to Checker to replace my left front blinker light and went through some extensive light checking and so found this news odd. i kept saying as much, and he kept insisting and i was about to ask to see for myself when he calls out to another worker ""Hey, was that the honda with the lights or the jeep?"" the other guy says ""the jeep."" however, there was no other car in the place. hmmmmmmmm.

OK, so i pay up ($24 altogether with a tax or fee or something added in) and go back into the waiting area while they finish up. I decide to use the bathroom -- and this is where the they lost two stars (this was, up until then, quite possibly a four-star experience - wait, two stars for a bathroom, you ask? oh, you just wait...)

the bathroom was filthiest thing i have seen in my life, and i've been to some raunch truck stop pee holes. literally, piss, in the bowl... i get in closer and i shit you not (pun intended) four shit smears in the bowl as well (yeah, i counted). two rolls of TP hanging out on top of the dispenser, each with one square left on them. realizing i need to sterilize my hands from just walking into this mess, i discover no soap or paper towels (not very surprising). as well, hair clippings all over the sink, like the guys are trimming their moustaches on their break. un-freaking-believable. i am still haunted by this bathroom experience.

1025,W7xb2iS4cYL14Yi5LOGSkA,2012-07-20,mYQUMTcBhBp_NTaj7gQr8Q,1,"I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following:

1)I have only been to this place once.
2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine.
3)I am a sympathetic person to servers, as I have been one.

That being said, I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.

About six months ago, at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.

We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave.  All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar). 

Since my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said, ""I can't imagine it will be much longer."" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.

Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?

We left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything.",review,YnuPa08WRFw_VYQsb3rcoA,0,2,0

Daytime:
The pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count I'd say. That's no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I'm being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the ""worst and trashiest"". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.

Nighttime:
Much improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it's a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I'm a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o' cash.

Rooms:

Average food. The burgers were average. The lettuce was wilted, the tomato was green, and nothing outstanding about the flavor. I'd say better options nearby are Joe's farm grill, In-n-out, or Culvers. 

Cleanliness was average. The floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat. The kitchen appeared clean. 

Service was below average/horrible. The cashier was very unpleasant. We all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about 15 minutes prior to the 2nd part.

I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it. 

Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers. 

We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. ""If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms."" ""If you choose option B, then only here"" . The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. ""Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!""   From there he was down right rude.

I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience.

Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and ""come back and try us again."" He made no effort to ""make things right"" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back.

1115,NleiJA9dpfKjhxe0cCD1MA,2008-04-17,7tg3X6RPdDYiyracX4YIuw,1,"We decided to hit up the ""Wine Down Wednesday"" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong:

The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.

We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.

20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.

It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...

By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own ""Wine Down Wednesday"" at home.

I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of ""if I could give them less than 1 star I would"" comes in...

I've attended 2 events there and its basically a disaster in trying to make your way through the 200-300 patrons they bring in.  You get funneled in past the food trailer into the bar area which is packed with people standing among several oversized tables.  Only if you've been there before can you figure out that you can walk towards the boxing ring past the crowd to get behind the stage and into the retail area.

2.  There are rules to what you can get at which station.  One spot is just wine.  Another spot is just mixed drinks.  Lemonade - oh thats a different place entirely.  

3.  They use the boxing ring as the ""stage"" for shows.  Very hard to view the show there because of the odd angle its at.  Both times I've had to stand in the retail area while the performers faced the seating/bar area (which only seats about 75 people).

Ummm... OK. When he finally dragged me here, I realized he probably likes it because the waitresses hit on him. (Honeybuns, if you're reading this, they'll do anything for a tip. ANYthing...!?)

I got a veggie egg white omelet, which had all my favorite components of caramelized onions and broccolini, but it tasted as if they had sauteed the veggies in the drippings from the burgers that just came off the grill. Uh, gross. This alone takes the rating to two stars, and I'm not even a super-strict vegetarian. It's just disgusting. The English muffin was this weird little hockey puck that really served no purpose other than to serve as a vehicle for the tasty, homemade apricot preserves that came on the side. The chocolate cherry scones were delish and the coffee quite good.

The booth next to us held three 20-somethings (two dudes and a chick) downing mimosas, still wasted from the night before, who thought it fun to play their cell phones and/or iPods at high volumes. Just annoying as shit. Later, when I visited the swanky bathrooms, I saw the girl out crying in the lobby. Guess the swordfight didn't end well.

Parking was an issue. Despite our early reservations, the only parking available was in the next lot over. One had to traverse an earthen embankment and a grubby alley to get to the place. Tell your companion to wear something other than high heels!

I dislike places that serve olive oil in place of butter with one's bread. I know it's fashionable, but it gives an impression of economy. That's fine for Macaroni's Italian Grill, but detracts from the tone of a place with Tarbell's pretensions. I'd prefer it if they'd serve both, or at least give one a choice. 

The soup of the day, potato and leek, was of delicate flavor but redolent of Potato Buds. Could it be possible that they're making this stuff out of a dehydrated product? The Caesar salad starter was a nonentity, and might have been improved by a little ground pepper, which wasn't offered. 

My bride was mightily impressed by the grilled salmon....some of the best she'd ever had, she said. The effect was somewhat dissipated by the peculiar potato product offered as a side. If you like to peel off and eat the crust around the edges of a pan just used to bake scalloped potatoes au gratin, you'll like this stuff. 

I had the pork chop, which was very good without being memorable. It's served with a side of what they claim to be 'wild boar bacon' and unidentified greens. The pork, independently, was bland and without much character; but spear a bit of pork, add to the end of your fork a fragment of bacon, and then a green or two, and the dish is much improved. 

Dessert was uninteresting. The sorbet was of the store bought variety....and not top shelf stuff, either....and the apple tart was bland and as dry as if it been left in the oven overlong. 

The ambiance of the place leaves a lot to be desired for a celebratory experience. It might work for a business meeting, but it ain't no place I'd care to take a date, ever again. The dining room is crowded and noisy, making conversation difficult and at times impossible. The tables are too close together and I had to endure a face full of server's butt whenever he waited on, or cleared the dishes of, the folks at the table neighboring ours. 

I suppose I've saved the best....or the worst....for last. I haven't been as rushed by the waitstaff at a meal since my experience in an Army mess hall at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. The place is being run as a money making machine and that means that they are trying to turn over tables as many times as possible in an evening. Services is overly rapid and one feels pressured to finish up and allow the waitstaff to get the next course on the table. The object, of course, is to get you fed and out the door, freeing up a table for another party. My wife resorted to the tactic of picking up her fork when she saw the bus-guy approaching....otherwise he'd be on us to clear the plates containing food over which we were tarrying, in his opinion, overlong.

The check was presented to us the moment it was ascertained that we had completed dessert but before the plates had been cleared. I returned it asking that she bring it on AFTER we'd finished our coffee. Which, by the way, hadn't been offered, either. 

To his credit, the dining room manager did come over to apologize for rushing us, and comp'ed our coffee. He explained that ""the standard in America is to present the bill when dessert had been finished"". I beg your pardon? Not in any place I've ever dined, and I was born in Ohio.

This place seems popular enough on a Saturday night, but I certainly won't be gracing its dining room any time soon. At this price point ($175 including wine and tip for the two of us) I expect more than what was offered. 

Sorry, folks, I know this sounds like a rant, and to some extent it is. It was an important evening for us....after all, twenty years only comes once in a marriage (well, most marriages, anyway)... and we had hoped for a gentler experience.",review,To6VfMpjPuiixoT4uq_mIg,2,6,2

Haven't received anything yet. Now I know that the turnaround time on cards is between 12-14 days, but I didn't receive any confirmation that they'd been shipped, or what method they were being shipped through. Luckily I was able to call them and talk to people who straightened everything out, but I really get a strong feeling that they're a very small company that's still trying to learn the ropes.

The biggest problem I had was that my shipping and billing addresses are different. There's a box where you type in your shipping address, then it takes you to the billing section. When I got my order confirmation, I noticed that my billing address and shipping address were listed as the same at the top of the order, then lower down in the order section was where I had typed in my correct shipping address, yet it was partially cut off. I called them about it and they assured me that it was shipping to the correct address, however once I called UPS and had them reassure me that my cards were coming to the correct address, I received another email from Taste saying that the reason my samples weren't delivered was because I didn't give them the correct address. I looked back at my confirmation receipt and the correct address was typed into the bottom of my order. It was a matter of not paying attention I guess.

Suggestions would be to either pay closer attention to their customers entire order, or to work on the billing/shipping page instead of leaving it as a box to type words in, especially if it's not going to be read.

Pros are that they get back to you very quickly and make sure that your custom order is correct for print.

The word mock appears on the menu no less than 30 times, and that made me want to flee pell mell at mach 1 out of there, sonic boom be damned. I understand it from a  marketing strategy to appeal to and or convert the carnivores and omnivores I suppose. Do meat eaters feel better about eating something vegetarian as long as it is shaped like a chicken wing? Has anyone gone to a steak joint and had mock carrots made from pork medallions?  I am also aware that we eat with our eyes, have preconceived notions of certain types of cuisine etc. However, I firmly believe that if an establishment uses veggies, legumes, tofu and such and gets creative instead of trying to reinvent the meat wheel, the end result would be much better. For Example the Mexicali burger, no mock meat reference here. How about listing something as ""whatever the hell it is"" served Parmesan style?

The brown rice that was the bedding here was ok, lukewarm at best. the dish lacked any real flavor and there was no spice whatsoever.The tofu tasted as if it was freezer burned, which really dumbfounded me. I think it may have been crisped long before it was served to me and microwaved, the texture was just off. Copious amounts of cock sauce, err... Sriracha saved it from blandsville.

So when I told my waiter I was having a ""bad toast experience"" and he blew me off, you can imagine the impact.  I ordered the oatmeal as well as the basket of toasted willow breads served with a variety of jellies, Nutella, honey etc.  My oatmeal came out with over-buttered, grilled bruschetta-style toast; that's it--a plate with a bowl of oatmeal and 3 pieces of bread.  I asked for flatware, then brown sugar and milk, then inquired about my basket of willow bread.  The waiter said, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal.  I reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam.  I decided to stop complaining (cus I had been making ridiculous requests like being served what I ordered and having utensils).  I put jam on the ""toast"" and it literally tasted like they had grilled it in bacon grease.  Meanwhile the table next to us (the only other occupied table in the restaurant at 10 am on a beautiful Sunday) was getting their cranberry walnut and sourdough bread, perfectly toasted with all the accompaniments.  I told the waiter I wanted toast like theirs and that mine tasted like pork (still a veggie after 25 years) and he said again, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal"".  My friend was getting embarrassed, so I gave it up and left.  How hard is it to bring a girl a new piece of bread?

Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again ""What in the HELL?""  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap.

Terminal 4 is configured rather poorly.  The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.
.  
To go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.

The other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.

Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on ""special.""

The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good.

It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. 

The room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.

FYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.

My main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.

I guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities.

One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.

Second of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.

I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.  

And lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.

So needless to say...I AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.",review,-ZVmHZcdn_OH52QWwSMimA,0,1,0

I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY, especially green chile. When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.

When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said, ""Well, we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican"" and walked off. What?!?!

The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction. I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no. Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation, had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.

I'm far from being a vegetarian, I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it. Also, I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan, maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...

I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.  Iceberg lettuce, slimy greens, cooked onions and bell peppers, mushy tomatoes, half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck.

I have no idea why. Is it because it's in Arcadia? Is it the added expense of upkeep involved in over-stocking the wine section, or the fancy olive bar, or the gourmand cheese selection?

While having just stopped in at the Ranch Market to pick up a few groceries, I was going to eat at the Market itself but decided to maybe try a place I had never tried near by instead. As I took my groceries to the car, I decided that since I had not yet tried ""Tradiciones"" I would give them a try. 
I enjoy the food at the Ranch Market-- tasty and authentic.  Since they are connected I THOUGHT the food would be the same. Boy was I wrong!  I don't know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better. 
The salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal. 
I was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco. 

The platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a ""mole"". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesn't mean it's a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona! 

The only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15.

Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am, now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..

Place is moderately busy as we walk in, I get to the counter, order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups. Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.


Fast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..



Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. ""I'm a wishful thinker""

Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by ""place was trashed"" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said"", oh sorry forgot"" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.


Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..

Short list

-employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.

But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..

Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.

Where I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point. 

At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish. 

He took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment. 



In short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location. 

I do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.


I will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.

Here is why I can't give him a good review (and this is solely based on my personality and preferences while dealing with the service industry- others may think he's wonderful...)

1)  I purposely chose an early morning (7:30 a.m.) appointment so that I would get to work by 9.  My office is less than a mile from his office and I was still running into work at 9:05 a.m.  This is due to the very long-winded soap-box like speech that Dr. Greene gave me.  I am a get-in, get-out type of person who hates small talk and hates self-promotion even more and if I heard him tell me how often he visits the gym or works out one more time, I probably would have gauged my eyes out right there to never need an optometrist again.  I also learned all about his wife, friend's boat...you name it...he told me about it (completely unsolicited).

2)  I am an educated individual who does not need an hour-long explanation- filled with graphical references and cutesy anecdotes- about why I now need progressive lenses.

3)  The fear-inducing sales pitch by the staff and the doctor was a bit much.  I realize that all optometrists and dentists are going this route now- ""buy this test (not covered by insurance) and be free from worry that you'll instantly go blind""; however, if I want something, I'll ask for it...just like any other retailer.  

Like I said...I got what I needed, a solid eye exam and prescription.  However, I purposely did not buy glasses there due to the doctor's cheesy personality and the ""hard-sell"" environment.  Again, there are obviously (based on the other posters) people who are attracted to this type of personality...I am not one of them.

That wouldn't be a problem at all except that our waitress didn't return with menus until close to 10:30 and then returned to take our orders at only a few minutes before 11.

The rest in cash"" She continually read back excessively complex scenarios, and we kept asking her simply to put twenty on the card, that's all.

When she returned, she had taken $20 of our cash towards the bill, charged $60 to the card and kept the remaining $55 in cash as a tip. That's just shy of a 75% tip she assigned herself. 

We spoke to the manager, who couldn't find her for some time, and when she showed up, she blamed us repeatedly. She finally refunded the card and brought us our new bill, with the extra drink.

It wasn't worth arguing about at that point.

The sad part is that everyone at my table, and our surrounding tables started telling similar tales from past visits. I guess this kind of service is not uncommon.",review,1F5G7Tdo14xzsGyISkHDvQ,0,2,0

Honestly my lunch was just okay
Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata
Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype

But, I am supposed to be honest.

This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.

The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. 

One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.

The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.

I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. 

I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.

So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. 

What I paid for this was ridiculous.
The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.
The food was meh.
Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there.
It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.

One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.

Matthew told us that they wouldn't fit in a bag. So my boyfriend said it was fine without a bag, but I knew they could fit one in a bag per box. So I asked for a large paper bag. Matthew held up the box to the bag And told me it wouldn't work. I just stood there and continued to place groceries on the line.

Walking in, I did not get the feeling of ""upscale"" restaurant. Sports on 2 TVs blaring out over the bar and into the open dining room did nothing for the atmosphere. They had a long table pulled together for our group in the center of the room, but I grabbed a seat at the bar since I was the first to arrive. Took a few minutes, but the bartender eventually gave me a wine list/menu, answered my questions, and proceeded to get my drink. They had a good selection of wines, and some you don't normally find on wine lists at every other place in town.

A few others came in and we moved to the table, no problem transferring tabs. Seemed to take a long time between everyone (about 15 of us, though we initially expected 20) receiving their drinks and the time the first apps came out. Granted, they were complimentary (the deal I worked out for my group), and they were quite yummy - especially the spicy tuna on tempura eggplant - so once we started eating, we forgot about the wait. The pate was very rich and served with soft slices of raisin bread. Some were immediately addicted to the bacon-wrapped dates.

Everyone ordered a burger of one type or another, some opting for the pre-selected toppings, other customizing and adding sweet potato fries. We confirmed that everyone was on separate checks. My burger came out not quite as rare as I would have liked, but what do you expect when the patty is only 1/2"" thick? I am not a big beef fan, anyway. Sauces were good, especially the pungent garlic parm, as were the fries.

But then, we waited for the checks...and waited...and waited. Seems the staff didn't begin trying to sort out who had what until at least HALF AN HOUR AFTER everyone had finished eating and plates had been cleared!

You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.


It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.

When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.

Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity.

I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.

I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.

me: ""Hi, one slice of pizza please""

Another friend got the chicken quesedilla.
Although I didn't taste it, presentation looked nice with the pico and guac on the side. The quesedillas were a good size and thickness. My friend took half of it home.

I can recommend the burgers, onion rings, and breakfasts.

Prices went up a couple of years ago to an average $9.49 for a burger plate, and slightly less for appetizers and other things. Service is always good, but don't go if you're in a hurry and the place is packed.

Also, if you are planning on attending a show here, plan on paying for parking.

I have seen some terrible sound guys here, but it's hard to say if that is the fault of the Marquee - a lot of bands that would play here tour with sound people.

The majority of the problems here are problems with venues of this size everywhere in the country - the parking, the over-priced shitty beer, the strip-search upon entry, the lack of re-entry.

Still, if there was any competition for a venue in that part of the Valley that could handle bands that are as popular as the bands that play at the Marquee, they'd be hard-pressed to do a less-enthusiastic job of it.

Also, the sloped floors make it easier to see a band from further away, but they also can KILL your back.",review,d2RAl63RTdfZF7kcuKcj-g,2,2,2

My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time, another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didn't get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone else's order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well. 

The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers. 

I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner, spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern. 

Again, food is great service is lousy. I am so disappointed and will not go back. I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls. I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable.",review,FmBpiDp6KMjlP3mKKp8vGA,0,1,0

Also, their pan Bolillo is really good and cheap and their cakes (3 Leches) are pretty damn good.

OK, so here is where the minus comes in.. the BIG minus.
My husband and I used to go occasionally for breakfast (I'd usually order simple, straightforward things like carne asada tacos.. don't get much simpler than meat in a corn tortilla).. well, the last time we did this, I found my meat... ready?... wait for it... to be the color blue and purple.  I had brown meat, but I had pieces of it that were blue and purple... no effin' joke.  I thought it was a trick of the eye, but I closely examined it and ... sho'nuff, that shit was blue and purple.  I immediately threw away my dish and never have I since ordered meat from their kitchen side.

That being said, I've also become more cautious in buying meats here... not to sound like a snob, but you bet I'm not buying my next cut of beef here!  I'm cool with their breads and their cakes and tortillas and such, but if it comes to meat, I'm out the door.

LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.

 I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work! 

But the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. ""Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right."" and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up ""hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up"". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that.

And I think that might be right...sometimes at Starbucks, it seems like I'm drinking something brewed from charcoal briquettes...it doesn't taste good:(

Now, I will tell you that I am really no connoisseur of coffees...I like coffee, you know...a good dark roast, made with freshly roasted beans:)

But the beans don't have to come from a specific plant , grown on the southern side of a special hill in Columbia and then eaten and pooped out by a badger of some sort.

No, I just want a decent cup of coffee at a decent price:)

Why can't Starbucks do that?

I occasionally need to meet someone for business, and Starbucks comes up as meeting place (and I understand that...they are almost annoyingly ubiquitous:)

I have sat at a cafe table on a street corner in San Francisco, having a cup of coffee at a Starbucks...looking at the Starbucks across the street...Lewis Black calls it ""the place where space and time folds in on itself""...I say ""why build the Hadron Super Collider to open a black hole?""...Starbucks did it a decade ago with a combination of charred coffee beans and vats of money to open a Starbucks for every adult in the United States:)

In and of itself, that's no reason for a 2 star review...Gordon Gecko said it best...""Greed is Good!"" and Starbucks exemplifies that credo...they are a generally very successful corporation grown up from the Bay area defectors from Peet's Coffee...I have no problem with success:)

No, my gripe with Starbucks is that they seem to be all about the marketing and not about the product...their coffee is crap:) So is most of the stuff they serve...it's second or third rate, at best.

And just because it's convenient doesn't mean we all need to stop in.

There is better coffee and better tea and better everything around...at much better prices...it's worth looking for another meeting spot:)",review,du6KeE54IFbPiXpU3LOd1g,8,9,7

There are tons of sit down expensive lunch places and lots of fast food (junk food) places too.  When I read the reviews on Chestnut Lane I hustled right on over.  The concept is right on but the execution leaves a LOT to be desired.  

First challenge is getting a parking place and I was lucky.  The line to order didn't look too bad when I arrived so i was feeling lucky.  However, the line took forever to move forward causing the people waiting to shuffle back and forth in a very confined space as there was lots of foot traffic trying to enter and exit.  The woman at the register took each order, processed the payment, and then proceeded to prepare the drinks  and sides for each order.  The drinks are somewhat specialty items and are kind of labor intensive, especially considering that the order line is at a total standstill.  SLOW!  After way too long a wait, I finally was able to order...then the real wait began!  It was a good 25 minutes before my order came up and it was just a TURKEY SANDWICH!  I felt lucky, though, as the woman ahead of me in line was still waiting for her SANDWICH after I had finished mine and was driving away!

Sometimes a long wait is mitigated by the awesomeness of the food.  Well, at Chestnut Lane this is unfortunately not the case.  I mean it was a decent turkey sandwich, but when I saw the almost $16 charge for a TURKEY SANDWICH and ICED TEA I was expecting something fabulous.  It wasn't all that.

It looked like dog food with a piece of steak in the middle. Really it was a terrible presentation. My husband's plate looked the same. The other two at our table ordered from the Rokerij side and at least it looked a lot better. The two bacon wrapped shrimp were flavorful and my steak was over cooked for medium but OK.

The (seemingly) canned answer is because the order comes from corporate, in North Carolina or somewhere far, far away where there is no phone or email access.  I go to buy Sculpey... OUT!  Same answer as to when it might return.  I need Faber Castell PITT brush tip markers...  OUT!  The same story with some airbrush materials.

The clerks I have dealt with there are part of my rant.  Of the handful that I have dealt with, (mostly morning and daytime) it seems like they don't really know the store well or give a crap to give some insight on their products or company.
They do have a big store and I understand that there is alot of inventory to know about and be able to locate but that is your job.  It just seems like nobody that I have dealt with there is really keyed in on knowing their stuff.

This location, on the other hand, could take some hints from there now defunct location to the west.  I have been to this location 4 times with each visit hoping the previous one was a fluke.  I always would get their flagship item as well, wings.  I like the spicy garlic which I find as the best balance between flavor and heat.  Each time the chicken was either overcooked, under sauced, or both.  Why can't they do their staple item right each and every time?  Major disappointment, times 4.

I won't elaborate on the other shortcomings of this location because they are too many.  The bullet points are that the service is very lackadaisical with anything.  You sit down waiting longer for the service to take your order than it takes to get it out to you.

Hits:

+ Food was tasty.

+ Ambiance was nice.

Misses:

- Waitress was never able to bring the ""last call"" round of HH she offered.  No explanation or apology.  

- Asked if I ""minded"" anchovies on my salad.  I said ""no,"" but didn't realize there would be an upcharge until the final bill came.

- While in the bathroom, observed one of the staff go straight from the stall (not the urinal) to the Kitchen.  No hand-washing, not even a pause by the sink.

And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.

So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My ""veggie"" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was. 

Eggplant.

Ohhhhkay then. 

It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.

So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.

She didn't even look at me, didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me). 

So, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public: 

1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html 

2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. 

3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. 

4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. 

5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. 

Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. 

Oh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship).

Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon. Wow, that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money. Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1"") so I went to this salon... I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town, but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon)  I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved. .Again though, the coupon lured me in.

The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services.

Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.

I try to avoid WM.  I'm always warned about the possibility of TB or now, pig flu.  I think the hub just doesn't want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping.

I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.  I've spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.  He's a minority I guess bc as you all said, YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING and CAN'T GET HELP without attitude, usually.  

I'm standing there staring at 2 mgrs, and they just ignore me for a few minutes?  I didn't want to interrupt the conversation, so I waited.  FINALLY, one asks if I need help???  NAAAAAH, I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.  FOOLS!  

On my last visit, a customer said ""excuse me"" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.  I glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.  Then one employee pipes up with ""OH, I'm sorry ma'am, can we help you?""  She asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say ""You're welcome"", the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: ""THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.  NO, THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.  We're not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do.""    That's why, when I walk by an employee working, if they lay eyes on me, they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job, to avoid stopping to help.  WT?  What's wrong w/this management???  

I agree, you can find some deals and save some money, but the attitude is over the top.  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly, at least when I see them, and I can point them out.  If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above, I stay OUT of WM as much as possible, which is a lot.

This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  I've been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.  

The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.  

I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years. 

Sadly, the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.

A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special ""Chinese cakes"" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.  

If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.  Golden Phoenix's heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.

It seems like a great idea.  It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.  They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera....

I chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.  I added bacon for a dollar.

First, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if:
1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch??
2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full.
3.  They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.

At the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better?
Anyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.

I finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon.
WTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out, but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.

At this point, I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!

So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. 

But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."" 

So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. 

Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. 

Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

I am assuming that they are hauling the ones they do sell here from a different location or a centralized place where they make them, which completely explains why the glazes, etc. taste as if they have been sitting for a while. They are still ok dough-nuts.

The other thing that this place lacks is in the coffee.

Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.

Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.

Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) 

The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.

They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.

But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce. 

So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had.",review,6-cOlCHG9gTu1iwLVm0C8w,1,1,3

Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didn't say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence. 

Got the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bush's or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacy's, Honey Bear's, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. I'll have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume. 

There was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesn't appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place.

First of all, the waiter had no idea what the soup was or what kind of bread they had available since apparently their actual bread inventory bore no resemblance to the one printed on the menu. The waitress berated him for not knowing, and then went on to make it obvious she hadn't a clue herself. She tried to talk us into getting croissants. Neither of us were ordering things that belonged on croissants. My dining companion got a portabella burger that's a burger with a giant mushroom cap instead of meat for people sans veggie friends -and I got a chicken sandwich and Italian wedding soup. We had to repeat the order two or three times before the waiter got it.

The waiter subsequently returned my dining companion how she wanted her burger done. She gently pointed out that portabella burgers have only two possible states- done and note done. Such is the dichotomy of mushroom burger kind. ""Wait, you wanted a what?"" slurred the waiter. He had put in for a regular beef burger. Turned out, they didn't actually have a portabella in the place. 

We waited. The soup showed up in one of those skinny coffee mugs and the waiter tried to pawn it off on the wrong person. It was pretty good soup, but there was simply no way to adjust the seasonings without making a sloshy mess. 

My sandwich, well, it was OK. Nothing to write home about. I was very hungry and it didn't strike me until I was almost done the promised buttermilk ranch dressing was regular ranch with buttermilk.  My dining companion's fruit was on the old side, and her tuna melt not particularly tuna-tastic.

We are masochists. We decided to have some dessert. The one thing on the menu we wanted was, of course, not actually available, so we decided to just go with coffee. Mum ordered cold coffee. She specifically said, ""I'll have a small iced coffee."" I ordered a double shot of espresso. Not too complex.

P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a ""gourmet"" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced. 

Once you've paid nearly $14 for their ""orange peel chicken"", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.

Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.

Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's ""i"" so that it would ""fit on the signs better,"" or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great ""American Chinese"" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of ""wok charred beef"", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.

The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:

'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. ""Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant,"" Jim told me, pointing at the statues. ""It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing."" From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'

Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway.",review,8-2W5CmkDl9vrkxRpkiPRg,3,5,5

I told the cashier that the internet menu had it listed for $8.95.  She just smiled and said ""Oh, we get that a lot but we don't have a menu.""  I said, ""but it's on the internet with your address/web page""  and she said, ""yeh, I know we get that a lot but here's our menu""  and she handed me their copy-machine menu which did not even have the sampler listed.  I politely told her that they should take the menu off the internet if it's not right.  The sampler was 4 pieces each of wings, mushrooms, cheese sticks, zuchinni.

My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama. 

The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.  

As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.    

My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say ""are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"" or ""are we ready for dessert?""  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, ""we"" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.  

oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.

I had heard good things so I was really looking forward to some fun with good friends and good beer.  Unfortunately, I was drastically disappointed.  The service was absolutely terrible.  
The question of ""What do you have on tap?"" should not be a difficult one to answer.  Our server didnt feel like answering and instead pointed to the menus with attitude as if we were making her night miserable.  
Strike One.

Our group quickly turned from 4 to 8.  When we turned to our server to assist us in relocating to a larger table, she told us we could look around if we wanted to, but she didnt think it was possible to accomodate a party of 8.  We asked about the upstairs and she told us there was a private party and no room.   A friend of mine went up anyways, to see a perfectly open table with 8 lovely chairs.  He asked the private party, which was paying the check and getting ready to leave, if they minded we sit at the other table.  Of course, they didnt care at all and we moved ourselves.
Strike Two.

Despite the bad attitude and completely unaccomodating service, we managed to rack up quite a bill between all of us.  I waited tables for four years and consider it a given with such a large party and hefty bill to offer separate checks.  Before we could even ask, the SINGLE check was dropped with 18% Gratuity added to it.       
Stike Three.

The food was average at best.  I've had better Potato Skins at TGI Fridays.  Its a shame, because this place is a $5 cab ride from my home and I really wanted to like it.

Bar Smith though? They failed on so many levels. 

I got there sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 and there was about a 20 minute wait out front. Not the end of the world or anything but after finally getting in, there was a sea of bodies and another very long wait. About 50 people were lined up by the stair case waiting to get upstairs. There was a bouncer not allowing anyone up there until people would slowly trickle out. Why they put Z-Trip on the patio, I don't know. It's the size of a shoe box and was clearly to capacity before 11 PM. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL!! 

I was in various lines roughly 50 minutes and still hadn't made it upstairs. Forget about stepping out of line to get a drink because you'd lose your place. The short of it is I paid for pre sale tickets, managed to get there at a decent time, and still had to wait close to an hour just to get in the same room as the guy. It was a total let down. 

At that point I was so ready to just walk out and ask for my money back. They clearly oversold the event and didn't give much thought about their patrons who paid money to see this DJ. They were going to fit every last body into that place if it killed them...and everyone else in there. 

After finally getting upstairs there were so many bodies, no one could move at all. It was a total clusterfuck. I finally made it to the back bar and stood in line for 10 minutes just to find out their card reader broke earlier in the night. Fantastic. No signs saying it was a cash bar, that would have been a nice gesture. 

Also, the bathrooms were downstairs, so forget about having to pee AT ALL during the 2+ hours you're there. If you had to go, you better hold it, otherwise you'd be waiting in line for another 30 minutes just to get back up. 

By the time Z-Trip came on, the sound was bass heavy and mildly distorted. I inched my way to various parts of the patio but the sound didn't get any better, so my partner and I said fuck it and went downstairs for the rest of the night. Thankfully they were playing his set downstairs and upstairs. At least people could move more easily downstairs. Plus the sound was better. And the bathrooms were actually accessible.

It would've been an OK breakfast place if it wasn't for all the hype. I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal, I purchased it right away. I made my own omelette with chicken, garlic, and spinach. The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy. My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal. It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.

The icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice, their iced coffee. They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different. We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum, to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help. After reading other people's reviews, it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.

Sorry Over Easy, you were quite disappointing.",review,NVZ_DCjzJhflzwsMtcF9PA,0,1,1

My party of 7 and a baby got to Pappadeux's around 6:30. We were told that it would be a 30-minute wait. It ended up being more than an hour. We were standing right in front of the hostess station, yet no one ever came to give us updates on how long it would be for our table. We would go check about every 20 or so minutes. One time we were told that our table was ready. When we went to check on it after about 20 minutes we were told that they were waiting on a busboy to clean it. A few minutes later they were still waiting on a busboy. In what universe does it take a restaurant 30 minutes to find a busboy to clean a table? We watched group after group after group get seated. A group of 7 that came after us was seated before us. We ended up being sat next to them; by the time we were getting our menus, they were finishing up their meals.

Once we were finally seated, we waited almost 10 minutes before someone came to our table to introduce himself as our waiter. When he asked how we were doing, we kindly told him that we were a little frustrated because it had taken more than twice as long as we were told, and we had been told twice that they were waiting on a busboy to clean the table. The waiter said that it was a busy night and said that he didn't get paid to deal with unhappy customers. He asked, ""So are you gonna do this or what?"" WHAT?! It was so rude - I don't know how he meant it, but it came across as sounding extremely annoyed. We were appalled and my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager.

The manager came over and spoke with my boyfriend. Not sure what was said, but after that things got much better. The manager brought us an appetizer plate on the house. Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator. I got shrimp etoufee, and it was great. The gumbo wasn't so fabulous. Overall, everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got three different drinks, and they basically tasted the same: like cherry Nyquil.

So, initial impressions: Seemed like a confused ambience. Kind of clubish, with a little hubristic haze. The music was the only positive part, reminding me of HGTV's 'Selling New York.'

The waitstaff seemed somewhat confused, as we had 2 waiters at one point, but the bussers were top notch!

We were also sad to hear that the ""Happy hour"" menu was only in the bar.

Now to the food: The menu and the prices associated gave me a bad feeling right quick. I am too used to excellent sushi, at fair prices, as well as happy hour menus with all the favorites. (Especially dragon rolls! YUMZOID!) 

We proceeded to order a couple appetizers, and a handful of rolls. None of which were memorable in any positive light:

 The avocado roll was insipid with a strange clash of textures and flavors. (Soft avocado, and carrot sticks likeyourmompackedinyourbrownbaglunch and a strange dusting of what tasted like bread crumbs...) The spicy tuna had to be the only one that was acceptable, and it was interesting to have chunked tuna vs. the usual frappe. The softshell crab was weak, and the spicy yellow-tail was spicy, but pretty one-note, and not satisfying. 

 ***Bottom line: We decided to pay our bill, and then go straight to one of our favorite sushi spots to satisfy the sushi craving that we definitely missed out on: HIRO sushi.

I basically told him that was too damn bad, and that I wasn't ordering $10 more in food; I was actually kinda saving them $10!

When they asked how hot I wanted my green curry chicken, I did a double take. ""Isn't green curry spicy by definition?"" They told me they make it in varying degrees of spiciness for the ASU crowd. While I disagree with diluting the authenticity of the traditional preparation, I get it - they have a business to run. What I really don't like is how they do it. They make a mild green curry...er, no, green sauce. Then, upon ordering, they add a certain amount of red chili flakes depending on how spicy you want it. This is not only upsetting philosophically, but chili flakes need time to cook in a curry - you don't just drop in, stir and serve.

The pasties I order are REALLY good... They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey's Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid.

I tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the ""premium"" pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me. 

Even that, I can write off to personal preference.

What really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself. 

It's a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back. 

On the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made. 

I don't really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i don't need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses). 

My worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the ""kitchen"" area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites...

I've wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as it's ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back.

Maybe I'll just have to take advantage of their take-out and stop at Tops liquor on my way home for the Hoegaarden...",review,QQUlKfw-MZGuOrf-B62wbg,2,2,1

1) I ordered a cheese platter. The platter was very much overpriced at over $18.00. The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them. The same is true with Pizza. If you order pizza there, it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza. Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it. AVOID THIS!!

2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon. We ordered two glasses of red wine. The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served.

The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines. To be sincere, you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill.

Oh, also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago. It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this.

My good friend and I were eager to see the type of energy that the new investors have injected into a local legend, the Wigwam in Litchfield Park. 

As time was flying by, in the last 10 years, the AZ Kitchen (also in the Wigwam Resort) closed for dinner.  This southwestern gem was also affectionately called the 'Snake Pit' by a friend but the service was top notch and it was one of the earlier restaurants that provided full view of the kitchen by diners.  The Wigwam's ballroom dining has now been converted to Red's Steakhouse. 

Service started out well with a nice touch of a choice of fruit for your water.  The waiter had recommendations but also allowed us time to ponder the menu.  We opted for the couple's dinner, essentially a prix fixe with a salad, choice of sea bass or steak, and the shared dessert.  We also decided to try the crab cake appetizer - just to adventure through the menu a bit; this resulted in a stern warning from the waiter that the steaks were 14 ounces. 

The crab cake was a nice presentation with fresh crab and a toasted crunchy top and colorful spinach bottom.   The side avocado dressing was a bit heavy for the crab and appeared similar to the faux guacamole at cheaper eateries.  However the crab was dry and the waiter brought more of this dressing out for us. 

The service with the Caesar salad presentation began to falter. The salad is the craze of serving entire stalks of the romaine and a toasted slice of bread.  Reminding the waiter for salt and pepper, he promptly provided a set and advised us the salt was also in a grinder. My friend determined that the pepper grinder was broken and did not provide a coarse grind and the waiter asked if we would like another pepper grinder.  Actually, for the prix fixe price of $45, I really wanted the waiter to politely grind the salt and pepper over our salads.  The crouton had no flavor. 

Our steaks were done as ordered but the NY Strip did not have a lot of flavor. The menu indicates the meat is grilled at 1600 degrees. However, my medium rare steak really appeared to be grilled on my a standard grill with no caramelizing or searing to hold in the rare juices. The steaks were true to size of waiter's tip. 

The steaks were served with two asparagus stalks which appeared to be white asparagus with green tips, a unique veggie for the plate. 
An au gratin potato patty also accompanied the steak and was quite yummy. 

As the server boxed up our plates, they brought out a raspberry mouse.  Its flavor did not impress either of us but my girlfriend did find the mascarpone center and it was addictive. 

Service was not astute nor attentive and sometimes baffling.  We were just into the meal when the waiter dramatically closed the drapes of the window near us. One of the other diner's called out in sadness to lose the evening sun but the waiter shushed her and said they would be opened intermittently to avoid blinding other diners. Could Red's should consider awnings or subtle window shades to preserve our dining views? 

The Wigwam may not be hoppin' just yet; but  as we left the restaurant, the three restaurants on Old Litchfield Road - outside the gates of the resort - were busy as locals may have enjoyed more reasonable fare and better service.

I could reason that it was the end of the day, that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through, or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant. But then, I tasted it.

It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts, and I'm sorry to report otherwise. It's was like a bomb had gone off. The tables were filthy, the machine handles were all gunked up, there was assorted debris on the floor. The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs. When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins, with no employees in sight. We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors. The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand, especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup. This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation, and no-one attempting to clean it up.

The stuff was real overpowering, to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like, it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be. Like, cheesecake doesn't taste like that, good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter, or banana. Where did the yogurt part go? And how do you screw up cookies and cream, exactly? The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet, and that's what we mostly ended up with.

The decor didn't add to our experience. Everything is a mint green, but it doesn't come off as retro or even minty, but more like dated and hospital-like. Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing.

A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register, only to disappear again soon after we paid. We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance, half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes.

The lack of professionalism that was presented when my fiance and I came to look at this venue. I will admit that we were 10 minutes late to our appointment, however I do not think this warrants being treated like a herd of cattle.

First when I called the venue to make an appointment whoever picked up the line sounded as if they were in a rush and not even interested in making the appointment which was the first turn off. Upon arrival, we walked into another entrance thinking it was the main entrance, then we were re-directed by an employee to the adjacent door. As we walked out there was (I don't even remember her name), the wedding coordinator waiting. She quickly greeted us then had us sit down as she began to talk about the venue. 

Usually when you want to sell the venue you run, you'd think you would see someone with a little enthusiasm and fire explaining why their venue is so amazing. Well, we didn't get that from this individual. What did we get? A quick 10 minute spiel about what they do and the services provided and 3 wedding books shoved in our faces as examples then a quick 10 minute tour of the place. That's it, no effort, no emotion, no interest in wanting to get to 'know us' and get a feel for what kind of wedding we would like to have, just a quick, here is the place, goodbye. She was very snooty and acted as if she was not in the mood to showcase the venue.

So why two stars instead of zero? One star is for the venue itself. It is very chic, modern, yet elegant. The reception area is beautifully decorated and where the ceremony is held is beautiful as well! There are many ways one can decorate this place! The other star is the PRICE. This venue offers all inclusive packages at unbeatable prices. I mean an all inclusive package where they provide virtually everything for roughly 100 guests is $9495.00 taxes and gratuity included!!! That's a steal, trust me, I've looked into a TON of venues, you will not find an all inclusive price as cheap as this. 

Honestly, if my fiance and I were the only individuals funding our wedding, then we probably would have considered this place (more than likely, VEGAS). However, given the type of customer service that was displayed, we took our business elsewhere.",review,zJlzNkIngaIV_crtUKdykQ,1,4,0

I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this spot, since I frequent the other spots on the same corner.  I had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling Postino's or Bomberos... or well... something other than a drive-thru.

I ordered the daily flatbread pizza.  It was a Chicken Teriyaki with prosciutto, pineapple and red jalapenos.  The ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality.  The chicken was a little gristly (sliced breast meat would have been nice), and the cheese was unspeakable.  It was straight-from-a-bag mozzarella... which was congealed into a huge mass of grease.  The pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings, that I couldn't even identify the crust... it was disintegrating before my eyes.  The prosciutto was all in one large clump, instead of being sprinkled throughout.  So disappointing.  My friend's caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil.  I love a good caprese - and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients.  Helps balance out each bite, you know?  No such luck with this one! 

Our service was fine.  Helpful enough in the beginning, but I think once she sensed we weren't thrilled with our food, she just tried to get away with a minimal amount of interaction.  The waitress never asked me how my meal was... even though I was clearly picking at it, and only ate half of it.  She offered to clear it away - not box it - so, she must have realized I didn't enjoy it.

I will definitely wait a while for a return visit.  Since it is close and has a great layout/atmosphere, I am hoping that they work out these rather large kinks and become the kind of place that I would like to revisit.",review,0dgQa81w5it1PMpGpC_L0A,0,5,0

There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite. 

Free-range and refills on beverages. 

Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting.

I'm not sure if there's a Central Market around here as haven't seen one yet, but even that is better than this in terms of price! 

We got a few items here, specialty items in bulk foods, for example. The wine and beer bar is cool, but unlike the Whole Foods in Austin, Tx, which was the epitome of awesome, (2) one can't walk around with beverage in hand here. Too bad the rules are so stringent about that, because if I were shopping with a glass of wine, maybe I wouldn't notice the horrendous prices quite so much.

My 3rd complaint is that when we ordered coffees from the coffee stand there, my mocha and my boyfriend's latte tasted like motor oil, after taking forever to be made, and the girl saw me swipe my card but THEN told me she ""didn't have a register person"" and I wasn't able to cancel the transaction....so then we had to go back through the main grocery line again. Grrr.  I left unsatisfied, uncaffeinated, and feeling like I had just wasted ten bucks on coffee that we ended up pouring out. 

They get one star for having a wine/beer bar at all, but then I have to take that star away because the bar tender said they sold the most beer and wine of any Whole Foods in existence (I call bs - the one in Austin is twelve times busier and people can shop with their beverage of choice, and they have a bunch of restaurants there too so it's truly an experience - it dazzles).

Innova is awesome, Canidae is for chumps.  Innova is also more expensive and a smaller bag.  Nothing I couldn't afford but annoying none the less. Not wanting to create dog food controversy I bought a bag of the morally superior Innova.

But when I checked out I was asked about four times whether I realized I was buying nibbles instead of bits.  ""You know you have the nibbles. Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if your dog prefers bits"".

Why they let me play, I'll never know:)

Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)

It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a ""Rodgering"":)

So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)

Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)

When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)

After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than ""regal"" atmosphere:)

They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)

The smell in S&J can only be described as ""extreme humanity""...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)

S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on ""tap"", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or ""boofay"" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.

It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)

S&J provided a table full of taco ""fixin's""...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(

They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground ""creature""...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.

I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, ""beef""...just not very good ""beef"":(

The hot tray holding the ""meat"" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of ""meat"" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(

But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.

I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(

I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(

One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not ""broiled""...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)

Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(

Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)

Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).

He came by 4 times before taking our order when we were ready after 5 minutes. Each time was a weird excuse. First time he came by I asked for a restaurant week menu, he said 'a restroom menu?' Why would I say that, then I ordered a glass of moscato and he's like the XXXX (whatever brand it was) and i looked down and it was the ONLY moscato.... I was like ya... WTF? So I screamed what I wanted and he's like oh.... sorry.... I can't hear. Then he said 'Oh hey, I'll be back to explain things.' Explain what? we're clearly ready! 'Oh hey, are you ready to order? Well let me go take the order of that big table back there and I'll be back to take yours' (real quote) WHAT? Seriously? We waited over 40 minutes to order. What's worse, is that we looked over like where the ef is this guy, and he was chatting at the bar!!! What, were we not wearing the right clothes? Were we not hip enough to be served? Or was it that we were ordering off the restaurant week menu, are we not ordering enough to get service? Come on.

 So he finally took our order, and we each ordered all three courses at once, because who knew when he would decide to come back. We got drinks, everyone got beer, except me who ordered the moscato. This was good, but was served in basically a thimble, it was the smallest glass of wine I have ever seen. Then we waited... and waited... and waited. We ate the whole basket of bread (which was great, but overshadowed by our terrible service). We got our appetizers, we had at least one of each available (a peach soup, a salmon flat bread, and a fetoush salad). The soup was really weird, not bad, just different. The salad was overpoweringly oniony, but still tasted good, although it was supposed to have toasted pita and had one tiny piece... and supposedly the flat bread was good, but I don't like salmon, so I didn't try it. Then the waiter came by and said 'oh we're really busy tonight, that's why it's taking a long time for the food) Notice there was no apology or accommodation of any kind. He also asked if we wanted bread with dinner, we said yes, but no bread ever came... weird. 

We waited and waited and finally out food came. I ordered the chili chicken, the two boys ordered the meatloaf, and my other friend ordered the shrimp. I thought the chicken had a good flavor, but was really dry. The meatloaf was fantastic! It was really quite delicious, with onion strings, mushroom jus, and mashed potatoes... yum. Supposedly the shrimp were really spicy, but again, I didn't try it. We ate everything, so again, the food was good, the service was awful. 

So then the waiter comes by (about 10-15 min after we had finished) and says, oh do you still want dessert? um.... yes, we ordered it and it comes with our meal.... he says 'oh, cuz I think we just ran out of the pot de creme, but I'll look' Well two people had ordered the pot de creme TWO HOURS AGO!!!! Why weren't they left aside? 'Oh we had 200 more people show up tonight that expected' Well, We had a reservation, so it is not our fault that you cannot staff your restaurant appropriately or turn away customers when you are too busy to handle new diners. It does not make sense. What kind of greedy restaurant is this that they can't refuse a table when people who told them they came to eat there can't even get anything off the dessert menu. It turned out they had one left, then the other person who ordered it said, oh ok, i'll have the peach crisp then....'oh, well we're out of that too cuz like it's made fresh from peaches and we didn't buy enough for all of the extra people....' 

Maybe if we had been served in a TIMELY manner instead of over two and a half hours, they wouldn't have run out. Oh, and maybe if the jerk who was our server had put aside the desserts for us when we ordered it over TWO HOURS before the time when we actually got dessert, that would have been nice too. The desserts were good, the pot de creme was the best, the rest of us got a 'tiramisu' which tasted like cookie dough ice cream.... not exactly what I want in a tiramisu, but fine, I guess. 

Finally, we get the check (around 200$, so clearly we didn't spend enough money to warrant any service) and we right out how we want the bill split between the two couples, The waiter comes by, and the BF starts saying, oh we wrote down the amounts we want on each card. The snarky jerk waiter says 'Oh, you mean follow the directions, ok.' So much attitude! So rude. I wish we left no tip, cuz that's what was deserved. NEVER AGAIN.",review,3gIfcQq5KxAegwCPXc83cQ,2,2,1

That's extortion!  I'd much rather do the entire thing on the internet.  Then he tells me that the child's fare goes off of the regular rate which is only one dollar less than the internet rate.  What the hell?  Why would I ever want to sit on hold for 25 minutes to book a flight to get this crap?  Then they tried to get me to pay $15 more for the next class up (I know, upper class on Southwest - strange).  I asked what I got:  1.25 times the miles (yeah, you heard right 25% more - that's going to get me far), first boarding and a free drink.  I clarified that with a child I get to board first anyway (they confirmed this).  Then I asked how much a drink costs.  $5.

Since the change in ownership, I have been repeatedly disappointed.  The size of the menu has gone down drastically (which is understandable, Long Wong's menu was way too big).  They only serve slices of pizza at certain times of the day now (noonish until 3pm supposedly I think? and again some time in the evening) and you never know if they will actually have slices.  I understand that maybe they don't sell that many slices in the off hours, but I would gladly take a slice of pizza that was an hour or two old over none at all.  Not to mention even at 3pm it is not uncommon to get a pretty old slice anyways.

The burgers are so-so.  Better than McDonald's, but just really not that good.

I've only had the cheesesteak once, and boy was it a disaster.  I bit into it and what must have been a full cup of liquid poured out of it.  I'm not sure how this was possible, but it was almost like it was sabotaged.  I'm sure this was a one-off problem and that they are not normally like that, but I was horrified and have not tried another.

The owner is eager and you can tell he is really trying to make the business work.  However, the staff he hires can be very rude sometimes.  I've heard some snotty tones of voice saying they had no slices when I've tried to order a slice of pizza during the off hours and have been refused a simple refill of my soda when my order took far longer than expected.

Not to be a kvetch....but I consider myself to be an expert on Jewish delis.  As a New Yorker from a predominantly Jewish area and married to a Jew, I've had more than my fair share of experiences at them.  My husband and I woke up this morning with a burning desire for a good bagel, corned beef on rye, and a knish.  So I schlepped all the way up to the PV Mall to get it.

Ok, first of all, the decor is terribly schlocky.  Its kind of like the tourist trap Jewish deli you find in Times Square.  Its like a Disney version of a NY deli.  

I take my number and head over to the cold case to get some drinks....of course they didn't have regular lemon Snapple (and why should they?  Its not like every deli, pizza place, and convenience store in NY carries it....) but they did have Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray which is always a welcome sight.  Another thing they had in the cold case which I found to be odd were jars of Nathan's pickles.  Nathan's, like the hot dog place.  I would imagine a Jewish deli would have Ba Tampte pickles....I didn't even know Nathan's made pickles!  It was a little lame to be honest.

Anyways, I go up to the counter where there doesn't seem to be anyone working.  There was no organization to it.  So I waited.  And waited.  In New York, the deli is a finely tuned machine designed to move people quickly.  Chompie's? Eh, not so much.  When I finally did place my order, the guy who took it had a hard time punching it into the computer and asked me to repeat it several times.  Despite saying I wanted my bagel toasted several times I was given a cold, untoasted bagel.  I waited a little longer for my order to come up and went on my merry way.  

Here is the breakdown of the food we ordered-

Matzoh ball soup- Surprisingly good.  I have never had matzoh ball soup with carrots and celery...so much chazerei!  Just give me the matzoh ball! Although, I will admit, it was solid.  I wouldn't go all the way to Chompie's for it because I know that I can make it better in my own kitchen. 

Plain bagel ""toasted"" with cream cheese- Terrible.  The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didn't even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick! 

Corned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasn't very good, it wasn't corned enough.  If they make their own they didn't use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldn't handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing I've ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though.

Knish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but I'm also Irish....I've never met a potato dish I didn't like.  Until today.  I didn't even finish my half of the knish. 

Now for the prices.  What's with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, I've paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasn't happening.

I have been going there since it Changed from Weiss Guys to Diamond Car wash and now its known as Francis and Sons. It seems the service has declined for each change of ownership.
 
Today was the tip of the iceberg and I will not be going there again. The past 2 visits have proven to me that their customer service has rapidly declined.
 
I understand that every business needs to ""Upsell"", but it becomes an annoyance when they keep bugging me 5,6,7,8 times after I have said no. Don't even get me started on their glass repair salesmen....

I always get the Premium auto wash, a few weeks ago I went and when I got home I noticed they had not cleaned my dash or center console (which is included in premium). I also noticed they had not wiped down my tires after applying Armor All and it all splattered up to the sides of my vehicle after driving away, I wrote these off as a simple mistake and that it probably would not happen again.
 
Today's experience was worse. I took my truck in for a wash and I told the guy I did not have time for a hand wax (upsell) I was then pressured into buying it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed. No was not an answer to this guy, I had to actually walk away to leave this Pressured UPSELL.
 
Again, I purchased the premium wash. They called for the vehicle and I noticed that there were little black spots (mud?) all over the side of the truck. I told the guy about this and he said ""its ready."" I explained that it wasnt and started using my finger to poke at what was probably 20-30 little black spots all over the side, he gave me a disgusted look and told me he had to go get a clean rag. I asked for a manager.
 
The manager came and had the guy wipe the spots off, but did not seem to care at all and walked away before the guy wiped down half of the spots. I had already given a tip to the first guy and this guy stood there expecting a tip, I am generous with tips, but will not tip more because I had to ask them to fix their mistake.
 
Upon entry of my vehicle I noticed there was still some dirt on the floor and my center console armrest was not cleaned. I only took the truck in due to my dog leaving paw prints on the center armrest and hair all over the place...

When I reflect on the idea of buffets -- Sweet Tomatoes excluded, since lots of salad means lots of Good-For-You-ness, right?... --  I feel like I used up my lifetime maximum instances of buffet-eating in college, where the dining halls were all-you-can eat.  Anyway, this place just opened and is within walking distance of where I live, so my neighbors and I decided to check it out.  

Overall I wasn't very impressed with the food, even in comparison to other Chinese food buffets I've been to in the past.  In addition to a standard selection of Chinese buffet items (beef with broccoli, fried rice, sweet and sour chicken) they have sushi, pizza (for kids, I'm assuming), and a hibachi grill section where you can pick vegetables and meats and they'll stir fry it for you (included in the buffet price).  The hibachi stir fry I made up was OK, but the sauce added to it was too salty for me.  The sushi was bland and what you would expect from a grocery store.  They only had regular high-sodium soy sauce, as far as I could tell.  (I tried asking one of the wait staff for low-sodium soy sauce and there was a language barrier; he brought back another staff member to our table, who also didn't understand what I was asking.)  The egg roll I tried was really salty (even without sauce) and nothing to write home about.  Usually sweet & sour sauce can make even mediocre egg rolls worth eating, but the S&S sauce on the buffet was a downright-scary Kool-Aid-red color.  However, the fresh pineapple and melon was a nice touch, as were the 8 different ice cream flavors on the far end of the line.

I will say it was pretty cheap at $10 per adult, so if you're looking for a lot of food on a budget, it might be a decent option for you.  Personally though, I just think I am past the days of eating foods with scary salt levels, artificial colors, etc., so I won't plan on going back (though if I had to return for some reason, there are enough edible options so that I wouldn't starve).",review,anr3YEUMnFxGSwo7Ej4OeQ,0,1,2

For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but. 

The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait. 

Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days. 

I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me.

Obviously they need to staff better because you could tell he was getting flustered and was blatantly rude to a couple of the customers ahead of me. For my new (disposable) contacts it was $50. $50 for a two-week prescription! Are you freaking kidding me? Needless to say I went in with a headache and left with a migraine.

Oh and on top of that I thought getting a slice of delicious Costco pizza would help after such a crap experience but alas I was wrong. The lady at the food court (again there was only ONE person working) was rude and I felt I was in a drill line. She literally threw my receipt at me. Well, geeze thanks. Oh and the pizza definitely didn't taste like the Costco pizza I'm used to.

Furthermore, what the hell is wrong with people who live over here? Not only were the employees rude but so were the customers.

I noticed it was hard for larger parties to get a table. There isn't much space between tables. I played it safe and ordered a plate of salmon nigiri. I noticed there wasn't a large selection of raw fish. We ordered the peach soju and the spicy tuna tempura off the happy hour menu. I thought I would be getting a peach soju that's of a thicker substance, but it ended up being soju mixed with some peach sweetener that killed the alcohol. Maybe it was my mistake of ordering soju at a sushi joint. The spicy tuna tempura was a spicy tempura roll deep fried in tempura batter and then sauces drizzled all over each piece that was cut. I couldn't taste any kind of kick from the roll. STAY AWAY from the happy hour rolls. 

What i think might be helpful is describing what's in each roll, rather than listing all the rolls on a sheet of paper for you to choose and its quantity. I'm so used to going to sushi restaurants that give you free miso soup, salad, and gyoza. These tend to be the cheapest items on the menu to prepare.

I am usually toast after a half of one of the Top Shelf margaritas...and no joke, I could have passed any field sobriety test.

She was an awful waitress to begin with - although not intentionally - she just seemed to be way over her head and have some sort of short term memory problem.

2.5 stars.

Didn't really care for the interior, and the tables outside weren't beckoning, either.  It was very antiseptic and cold indoors, with only the menu handwritten on the chalkboard, the plain-looking pastry display case (devoid of any ornamentation or even a sign of any effort in making everything inside presentable), and, what looked to me, an antique-looking espresso machine on the counter to lend decoration to the all-white interior.  It was also very noisy indoors, despite the fact that there were only a handful of people!  

Ordered the Mascarpone and fig jam on marble rye ($4) and the Lox w/ cream cheese and tomato ($8 or $9), as well as a latte, no sugar.  The coffee came in a paper cup... why?  Made me feel like she wanted me to leave.  Loved the mascarpone and fig!  (So much so, I soon acquired a jar of organic fig jam from Whole Foods, but I need to find good marble rye toast...)  The lox, however, was disappointing.  While I found the flavors palatable, I thought the lox strips were too thin (I had lox at True Foods Kitchen that were wild-caught and larger for only a couple of dollars more), and the cream cheese rectangles looked strange with its right angles (after seeing such a lovely presentation done w/ the Mascarpone and fig jam).  Made me wish I'd had two sets of the toast!

A couple people there got a wrap, which appeared to be emaciated and a general poor excuse for a wrap which I'd like to pay money for at a restaurant.  I could make the same lame roll at home for about $1.

Forbidden is an ambitious concept--a gay club with two rooms and two deejays in a city not known for its gay nightlife. Sadly Forbidden does not deliver.  

The club is usually pretty busy on a Saturday night, but the crowd leaves a bit to be desired.  The patrons are mostly unattractive, kind of trashy in fact, and not very friendly.  

I believe deejay in the main room does not change on the weekends, where he spins top 40 dance/pop to a drunk college-aged crowd.  In the OZ room (the smaller room) they have different local deejays, who, from what I've seen, spin a variety of different types of music--sometimes it's circuity music, sometimes it's eighties music, it all depends on the deejay for that night.  The OZ room has been pretty empty the few times I've been there.  The sound system in both rooms leaves quite a bit to be desired from a place that calls itself a club.

I went back with friends twice after in the coming months and was pleased each time. 
I just went back this past Saturday though, and would have to say I would no longer suggest it for a special night out. It was as if the magic was gone and that the place was showing its age and loosing its ""specialness"". It was really just ok. The chef's talent shows, but too many other let downs. 
When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation the place was crowded. The host was friendly and told us that our table would be ready soon and it was. We sat down at our table and that's when things started turning out not as well as expected. Seated in a back corner--which I did not mind---I noticed the walls were filthy---scratched and beat up and dirty. That was my view, so of course its all I could focus on. The waiter did not show up for 5 min. to take our drink order, and when he did it took 20 min. to get them to us. He apologized, but at 8:45 on a Saturday night that waiting for a first drink is not fun. 
When then settled down with our menus and picked our choices. It was then we were told that they were out of the veal --which of course 2 of us had chosen by then, and that there was only one Skate dish--which of course the other 2 of us had decided on. They were also out of 3 other items. I felt I was back in the old Eleve (located in this same spot)--the food was great there as well---when they did not run out of many items on the menu. They may be ok when you have a larger menu, but with a small menu to begin with this is a real disappointment. 
Gone were the pop rocks that I thought was so fun as an intermezzo, instead a spoon of something that was not described was set down in front of us. A simple salad--good--was $15---and most starters are at least that much. Good, but not worth the price. Otherwise, entrees were good--not special, but tasty and served with good presentation. The cotton candy is still there--and still an attention getter. And I still love the desert selections---especially the malt that I had with mini doughnuts in with dipping sauces. 
I think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room, but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new, beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall.

They were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor., and we tried 3 different kinds. The peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls.

I had the Lemon Grass Chicken for dinner. The chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were overly sweet. I couldn't detect even a hint of the lemon grass. The presentation was unappetizing, with the overcooked chicken just slapped on to the side of the noodles.

I'm not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably didn't want to be negative, but neither of them made any positive comments about their food.

Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!

We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.

We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.

We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).

Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.

So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...

This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!

And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.

Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident.",review,c0QRCVqGQdRVPCFNGV_YAQ,1,1,1

For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement.

My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable. 

The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved.
They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed.
Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called ""dry-rub"" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange!

The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor.

Overall if they don't change the way they 'burn"" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it!

Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip.

Large portions.  Salad was a bit heavy on sauce, but I liked it.  Deviled eggs had some truffle oil which made them pretty good.  

Burger was gigantic.  Ordered onion rings that were just not good at all... must be frozen pre-bought, which sucks.  Burger kind of tasted oily bland.  Tried to add mustard, and it wasn't terrible, but for an upscale burger at $12 expected just a bit better.  Companion had sweet potato fries which were much better.

Service even though the place was dead was very slow.  Not unfriendly, but they need to realize people that go for a mid-week lunch usually don't have 1.5-2 hours to eat.

When we walked in, we were seated by one server. Then, a few minutes later, another host came up to us and asked why we stole a table and did we not understand how seating works? We were quite confused and offended, as we were seated properly and had done nothing wrong.

Then, once we ordered, we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Finally, we asked about it, and then it was out within a few minutes. They had completely lost our order.

When our food arrived, one dish (the Over Easy -- toasted brioche with spinach & an egg) was absolutely inedible. The brioche was so burnt that we could barely cut it, as was the bacon. The fried egg was very undercooked, even though we requested it completely cooked through. I was honestly shocked the server brought us the dish without saying anything, since it was clearly burnt.

The other 2 dishes (banana & pecan french toast, and the Loretta sandwich) were just alright -- certainly nothing to rave about. And, the 3 of us ended up splitting these 2 dishes, since the other dish was awful. We ended up leaving early because we were all so disappointed.

I have a sneaking suspicion that this is the go-to sushi place for people who either
 A) don't know anything about good sushi or
 B) have no taste buds and money burning a hole in their pocket

I didn't really know what to expect from this place before we arrived. I'd never heard of it before and the only reason we agreed to go was because it was close to my boyfriends house and our friend said it was pretty reasonable in price and quality of food.
My boyfriend and I arrived before our friends and we walked to in an almost completely deserted restaurant. There was some really bad techno remixes of popular songs playing in the background and an episode of Dr. Phil on the television. I sat down in one of their ridiculously tall bar chairs while my boyfriend went to grab us a menu we could look over while waiting for our friends to arrive. 
Most. Uncomfortable. Chairs. Ever! 
I couldn't have been sitting in it longer than a couple of mins before I had to get up out of it. The seat had an aluminum bar or something all the way around it that dug into my leg after sitting down. It's hard to describe how or why they were so uncomfortable, but if you've been here before you know what I mean. They clearly chose these chairs based on aesthetics alone. 
Anyway, our friends arrived and we all ordered our food. I decided on getting the ultimate salmon roll and I believe it was called the sun roll. I could be wrong on the name of that second one but it was something close to that. My boyfriend got a couple rolls and we decided to share a plate of tuna sashimi. For the 2 rolls I ordered and the plate of sashimi it was almost $40. My boyfriend got the sunshine roll and a las vegas roll. Those two rolls plus a drink was more than $20. So all together we spent more than $60. I love sushi. I would be more than happy to pay those prices for a plate of delicious fish. But what came out was not what I was expecting for the price we paid. 
My rolls were pretty, but they were almost inedible. I pretty much choked down the ultimate sushi roll. 2 or 3 pieces into eating it I debated wether or not it was worth finishing. The little tiny bit of smoked salmon that was inside was dry and I could barely taste the fresh salmon that was conservatively layered on top. I moved onto the whatever-sun roll and that was a little bit better but it was still lacking in flavor and texture. The sashimi was just awful. It didn't taste like fish, it almost didn't taste like anything, and the texture of it was really weird. It was almost chewy. My boyfriend and I have been known to just down entire plates of sashimi in less than a min or two, but after one piece he called it quits and it took me the entire rest of our time in the restaurant to finish the plate.
The staff was pretty nice, I mean they weren't going out of their way to be pleasant with us but they weren't rude either. 
All together I'd say this visit and the food was a total failure. I feel like this place's only saving grace is that it's clean and it's in a pretty convenient location. I would have liked to give this place another shot and try another couple of rolls before writing my review, but I was REALLY disappointed with the ""food"" (I am having a hard time even using that word because it was barely edible) I ordered. It wasn't the worst sushi in the world, but it wasn't anywhere near the best.

I went with a group of 5 (well, 4 adults, one kiddo). This is another one of those places that tries to be fancy and pretty much sucks -- for the price and portion size anyway. We ordered beef stew, chorizo stuffed dates, halibut, cheeze sticks, chicken and white cheddar waffles, and some beers. 

First on the beers... They have Four Peaks 8th Street on tap (privately labeled as Tucks Ale or something like that) and I was happy to see this -- I love this beer. However, halfway into my meal my glass was dry and it sat that way for a good 10 minutes. If you've read any of my other yelps, you know I expect a refill promptly, especially if you expect me for forget your marginal service and mediocre food... 

When the waitress came around, she asked if I wanted another beer, I said yes. Another 10 minutes went by, me parched, growing annoyed... When she came around again it was clear she forgot all about me, then asked one of my friends if they wanted another beer -- I assertively said YES. She looked at me and proclaimed her sorrow, said it would be right up. Another 10 minutes go by, she swings by and apologizes that they had to change the keg. I understand that -- but between the FIRST and second time I asked, I watched the bartender pour another 4 or 5 8th Streets. But I didn't get one.

As for the food? Super duper BLAND. Come on Tuck's! Fancy (read expensive) food should be an explosion of complex flavor in my mouth. If I have to put table salt and pepper on it just to taste something, you pretty much suck. If we pay $30+ per person and I leave hungry, you pretty much suck. The fried chicken was pretty good, but I've had the same quality stuff from the deli at Safeway.

you have hundreds of plants that are identical to oleanders minus the roots and resemble in price? really??? please list them so i can find out if you're a big fat liar. nope, not listing them. only wanted to get me there. i decided not to go because 1. it's raining, 2. he lied and said oleanders are ok. i just have to have the drip system on 24/7. thanks for your freakin help.  3. he's a liar so even if i went they would lie to me. 4. i hate liars 5. i went in before in the past and told them what i wanted, they gave me a free backyard design and they completely didn't listen to me and created a backyard that cost 2k. who do they think i am? i live in mesa for crying out loud. not paradise valley. i wasn't going to let them waste my time like that again.

The area is ok, and the hotel area seems to be pretty safe and well lit. The lobby and pool area are very pretty, but again...the doors open to the outside so when I was positioned right near the pool, I could hear everything that went on.  The bed was standard Hampton Inn bed (comfy) but the room was small.  My biggest complaint, by far, is how bad the noise carries.  I'm still sitting in the room and I can hear the entire conversation going on next door...I can make out every single word.  Additionally, I can hear the person upstairs.  Their sound insulation is terrible.  There is a gap around my door (and remember, it opens to the outside) so can hear everything that goes on outside, too.

The name itself ""Revo Burrito, Revolutionary Mex"" set me up thinking I was walking into...a revolutionary burrito joint!  My husband and I were disappointed to say the least.  He had the Chicken Machaca Burrito, which the counter girl said was her favorite.  And it was, well, just a chicken burrito, at best.  There was so much liquid oozing out the bottom from the wet lettuce and wet pico that he had to move his chips to another plate because they were swimming.  I had the Black Bean Burrito.  The menu had stated the beans were slow simmered in garlic, onions & seasonings...sounded delish!  However it tasted like they walked next door to Safeway and bought a can of black beans, heated them up and rolled them into a tortilla.  It was also supposed to include their ""special cheese blend"" AND there was only a SLIGHT SPRINKLE of cheese...literally!  I actually opened up the tortilla to make sure they didn't forget it.  Call me crazy, but when I order a bean & CHEESE burrito, I'd like to have at least a small amount of cheese.  I guess their idea of special cheese is magical, disappearing cheese.

The rice with corn & a drizzle of cream was especially delicious & the fresh-squeezed lemonade was tart & perfectly sweetened. We also liked the decor & the windowed kitchen.

I used to live by this Savers and would frequent it every day yes, literally every day back when they used to have great items. Just pop in real quick. Over time they changed the layout and experimented with things. 

After visiting today I saw that now everything is so crowded based on the way they structured everything using the same space with the same amount of stuff. The shoes are racked above the clothes racks now. This is extremely, extremely annoying. There is no emoticon to express how annoyed I am by this move. I understand they are trying to make the shoes central to the clothes so they are in the same spot, the shoes are racked by size of course snaking down each aisle. Sooo to look at shoes you have to go down a couple of aisles waiting for people to get out of your way, rather than have them in one spot like they used to be. Of course people are not going to magically put back shoes where they belong so you might find shoes in the right place, or you might end of having to walk down each and every aisle looking at the shoe size stickers making sure they are not cute and your shoe size respectively. Savers, please correct this annoying inconvenience. 

Also if you genuinely find an item with a tag missing they won't sell the item to you. Listen I get it, this is such a high traffic thrift store that there is a good reason for this but you must wait until the next day for them to price the item and put it back, they won't hold it for you. They don't call a manager over to simply price the item out for you, so how is this good customer service for the innocent ones? Why punish everyone? Why not do like some other stores do and mark the clothing label with a washable marker so that way if the price tag comes off, based on the color they have a pricing system set up? Either way, end up taking the time to re-price and re-stock it again. 

They should also implement some type of buzzer at the jewelry counter, I don't know how many times I have gone there, not just this location, only to wait and wait finally having to ask a cashier to send someone over to help me because there is never anyone there.

The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all. Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service.

The space is nice, but crowded and loud. The counter staff were indifferent. After being waved over to an open register, the fellow behind the counter took one order, then wandered off, leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order.

You are given a number (or not) and left to find your own table, scrounge up your own silverware, and wait for your food to be delivered. Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver, they were out of forks, and most of the tables were completely filthy. I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table, sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs, then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off.

Beverages are (apparently) serve yourself, although they didn't bother to say that when I ordered. I stood at the counter, waiting for iced tea, only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself.

If they happen to ""run out of numbers"", then they input your name with your order. Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant. Better yet, the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... ""Lisa? Is there a Lisa here?"" while your food cools. Inexcusable.

The only bright point: the croque madame was tasty. Delicious bread, ham, and a perfectly fried egg. But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming. However, the ""side of fruit"" made me angry: a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry, a few slices of strawberry, and 2 chunks of  green apple. Insulting.

I know....a busy Saturday night and so, perhaps I should give both the servers and chef a break? Sorry. The menu has changed and so has the quality of food - and not in a good way. Let me just give you a brief sample of our experience - the Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer has been changed to a lackluster combination of flavors. The idea of tuna with mango seems lovely however there is a total and complete blandness to the way this dish is now served. The former tuna appetizer was far more tempting. Moving onto the Goat Cheese Medallion Arugula salad. My salad was served sans medallion and literally laden with a huge glob of cold goat cheese and some terribly prepared mushrooms. What happened to the warm, crusted goat cheese? Next, we both ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sole. While the sole was prepared well, I do not recall this dish having a cream based sauce in the past. If memory serves me well, the dish should have had a lemon sauce delicately balancing the flavor of the fish. Cream and sole do not make a happy pair!  I am not sure if this was an error or part of the new menu. Okay, and for the piece de resistance we ordered a side of the Sugar Snap Peas which were actually drowning in a bath of some kind of soy and oil sauce. It actually made me ill to eat it - and my companion, as well. 

Our service was slow and unattentive - although I do realize service can be a very personal experience. 

I was sick with food poisoning all day Sunday - as if the poorly prepared food were not enough to bring down my joy. 

So, I caution those of you who may have once enjoyed this restaurant like me - think twice before dropping a pretty penny at Wildfish.",review,IibG_Dl9P24zExWisTEvMg,0,1,0

Most cheap drive through fast food Mexican places are alike. Of course there are slight differences. In this case it wasn't for the better.

We had to drive up to the window to order. The speaker box wasn't working? What was going on there?

I ordered a chicken chimichanga with sour cream & guacamole on the side. The chimi was big, just like I expected it to be. There wasn't much guacamole. I would have liked more. They also put tomatoes in it. That's ok, I'm just mentioning it. All in all this chimi just didn't sit as well as others I've had. Maybe it was the spices they used that were different, I'm not sure.

I also ordered a large horchata. I have definitely had better. It wasn't the worst I've ever had but it needed more cinnamon flavor, that's for sure.

It's cheap, it's easy, it's fast, it's literally right down the street from me. I'd still rather make the drive over to 7th St to my fave 'bertos though. See: http://www.yelp.com/biz/rolbertos-phoenix",review,ZubK3U5PlTWy4VIQG_Wpzg,0,0,0

The reason I gave it 2 stars is because the burger was very good and it was made the way I asked for it. My husbands burger was not.

But, the server and the fries left a lot to be desired. Let me preface by saying that we had been to several other locations. I like my fries crispy. I ask for them well done, extra crispy, scorched, tortured hollow tubes. Whatever their buzz word is for well done. The location will comply. EVERY OTHER 5 GUYS HAS COMPLIED. But not the one at TATUM AND SHEA. She said that corporate said they are not to cook the fries that way. So if we were to put up with soggy fries - yes soggy, then we did not want them. 

She also interrupted us several times which is rude. THEN she went and called corporate just to double check for us and she came to the table and said they said no they were not to cook them that way. Seriously? We did not ask for her to do this. She actually accused us of being undercover shoppers. We started to say something and then again- she interupted.

Listen, if you explain that our choice is not how the company wishes to present their product and we still choose to have them a different way, you should comply. It is after all our money and our decision. I was raised with the rules that #1 the customer is always right. And #2 if the customer is wrong REFER TO RULE NUMBER 1!!

We will not return. They have lost our business and I hope she loses her job.

Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all.

I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.

Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.

Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.

I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.

Taps looks like a sports bar when you enter. Only thing there appears to be only 2 TVs or at least where we were sitting I could only see two both above the bar. The decor is appealing, fresh, lots of light coming in from outside. 
We were seated and very soon offered drinks. When the drinks came to the table we had both decided on their special.  Soup and Salad. With this you get a tomato soup, as much as you want and a choice of several salads again as much as you want. 
Not sure why but lately I have had a hard time getting soup that is hot. The soup came out at somewhere well below the state required 130 degrees. We sent it back asking to warm it up. We got it back it was warmer but still not hot. My wife's salad came out with her soup my salad came out a little later. I got the wedge. My soup and salad was very good. My wife also liked her meal. So the food gets a 4.
The service was very slow. It took over 15 min to get the first of our meal to the table. I did order a second different salad as well as did my wife. This also took about 15 min to bring to the table. For what was going to be a quick lunch we were there about an hour. There was only 5 other tables in the place with people at them so the reason for being slow was not that it was crowded. 
The plates bowles they used to serve the food in is extremely small. By the time you had eaten you salad it was all over the table. It is impossible to keep in the small bowel it is served in. If you put the same amount of feed in a larger bowel it would be much better.

They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad.

Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. 

Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.

Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.

Maintenance people fix things quick but some fixes are sub par.. My neighbor and good friend continue to have water intrusion in there home when it rains hard. They have to have their carpet padding replaced multiple times because of water coming in from under the building. I work for a property management company myself and this half fixed issue is something that I'm not impressed with. 

Also, every year they increase rent, they don't work with you on price and don't seem to care about good paying tenants (Like myself). They are too corporate and only care about the money and not the longevity of good on time paying tenancy.. The only reasons I stay is because the location and price is good, but also because I hate moving around. I anticipate that rent will continue to go up and well over what other nearing apartments properties have to offer. This would mean that I probably have only another year or two left before rents over $1000 for a two bedroom... 

One good thing is that the staff is nice and friendly but supposedly Equity Residential (managing/owning company) doesn't give their property managers enough power to work with their tenants. It's unfortunate really because I would imagine that companies would rather have long term on time paying tenants and negotiate on rental amounts and try to weed out the consistent late or non paying tenants.

I said it's fine, she asked me  to pay cash right away! only cash she said!! And ask me to go to ATM to get cash! I was surprised, but didn;t think anything bad.

Her work was so nigligent in everything! Nail polish was all around the nails and my finger tips. I suggested her to correct it and remove an extra polish around and she did it only on few nails, repeating all the time :""Pretty? Yes?"" It was so far from looking pretty!

I'm a polite person by nature and never argue, but here it was just awful! And I payed her first together with the tips so she took 45 bucks from me

Her pedi was not better at all!! She was always in a hurry! She didnt let my nails  dry and started putting my shoes on me! I warned her that it must have been not done yet, but she didnt listen, she wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible, so all the nails went messy!!! She reapplied the polish but the whole procedure was just so frustrating!! I left the place more than just upset-I was really mad!

So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).

This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.

Complete FAIL. 

For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees. 

And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.

They found a couple shelter tubes (old & inactive), so I paid them to treat the house and bought a 2 year ""warranty"".  Included in the ""warranty"" is a free annual inspection and any follow-up treatments necessary.  Sounded good.

First, the good part: the treatment appears to have worked just fine as I have not seen any new evidence of creepy crawlies munching mi casa.  That's good for three stars, I suppose.  

But here's where I have a gripe.  Last fall (1 yr in to the new house), it occurred to me in passing that I'd been here a year and that I should be expecting some sort of contact from the termite people to schedule the annual inspection.  A call.  A letter.  Something saying 'Hey, you're due.'  

(I don't think this is unreasonable to expect from a service-oriented company.  Shoot, it's been well over a decade since I bought my car, and the original dealership still sends me letters saying 'Hey, you're due for your 150k service!')

I hear... nothing.  And pretty much forget about it.  Until...

Another year goes by.  I receive a letter from them, ""Hey! Your warranty is up for renewal!"" I don't recall if the first letter contains (paraphrased) ""By the way, we'd love to schedule your free annual inspection!"" or if that came in the 2nd letter... or the 1st or 2nd call.  Or maybe it was the 3rd letter and the 3rd call... 

It certainly was in the 'Hey, your warranty lapsed but if you respond right away we'll re-instate it for you AND schedule your free annual inspection' letter, though.

Which, frankly, irritates me.  A lot.  

I will not be renewing my ""warranty"" with this company as my experience has shown that I'd be paying for nothing.  

Summary: 

Treatment? Fine. It was effective.  I have no more signs of bugs.

I had just downloaded the Yelp mobile app and Harlow's was among the top burger search results for Tempe.

I know it's a great breakfast/sandwich/diner type place, but had never thought of it as a burger destination, until the Yelp mobile results.  So I headed on over.  Here's what I found:

It's not a burger destination.   

They offer 5 or so, starting with a basic burger, then different variations based on toppings... green chile, texas chile, bacon focused, etc.  I kept with the basic, plus cheese.  For $8 you get the basic burger with fries, and the variations bump it another dollar or two.  Drinks are extra.  

The menu said theirs were char grilled, but I think they are steam table cooked - no char or smokey taste on mine.  Likewise, I appreciate the regular menu featuring a lot of local product sources,  but I'd guess these are from a frozen patty national vendor.  It wasn't bad, but it reminded me of many tailgates where we bought the big pack of frozen patties and simply reheated and cooked them on a grill.

The service was good and fast.  The fries were decent, though nothing unique (also from a frozen bag?).  The bun was ok, and it came with pickle, onion and lettuce.  But it's still unclear if they made them there or used an external source for the patty.  

Bottom line:  After tip, I paid $12 for a burger, fires and coke.  There was no ""wow moment.""  If they produced something unique it might be worth it.  As it stands, I'd definitely recommend the place for other things, but not burgers. It's not their forte.",review,p4IrODgI_QmO5M9Q7gdURw,0,1,0

And THAT is how I ended up at Chompie's on a Tuesday.  They were featured on TV (I think it's Man Vs. Food, but I'm not sure) bc of this food challenge of theirs.  On Tuesdays, they have a special - AYCE Jewish sliders & fries with the purchase of a beverage for $11.95.  (Keep in mind, a plate of 3 Jewish sliders + fries is $11.95.)

I was told the specialties here are sliders.  The sliders themselves are a decent size (I'd say maybe it's the same size as the tiny McD's burgers, but taller?).  Jewish sliders have potato cakes in them; Western sliders don't; breakfast sliders are something completely different.

Everything we ordered was ehhhh (befitting of a ""meh, I've experienced better"" rating).  Two things that did impress me, however, were:

1. They place pickles on the table right when you sit down!  I'm not a pickle girl myself, but it's a nice gesture.
2. Everyone here is so FRIENDLY (I mean genuinely friendly!!).  Idk, I think most Arizonians in general are friendlier than the Californians I encounter on a daily basis hahahhaa.  And our waitress went out of her way to split 5 checks for our party of 7...that was pretty cool of her.

I'm glad I went here for the experience, but I wouldn't come back again.  Lesson learned: Don't trust a bunch of post-gym, hungry, non-Yelping boys to pick a dinner spot ;)",review,ANs4YACIYYoyAY6D7Xp4Pw,1,3,1

This location was, well, let's just say, it wasn't crowded.  And it showed in the service, very nice and attentive.  They were very patient when our party was supposed to be 8 people, then ballooned to 12 people, then 13.  Unfortunately, one of the solutions to accommodate us was to put a couple of square tables 'attached' to our eight person round table.  I *hate* this.  It's just awkward for at least half the people, and then the people that get stuck at the 'junction'...sucks...

We ordered some apps, though the only one I tried was the saganaki.  It was definitely good and the pita bread that it came with was nice and warm.  For a meal, I ordered a gyro pita.  Now, I understand that this is a 'full' greek restaurant, and maybe I shouldn't have gone with a gyro, BUT, that's what I was in the mood for, and being a basic greek food, shouldn't be hard to make a good one right?  Well, apparently not.  I've probably gotten gyros at ten places around town, and this was definitely the worst one I've had.  The pita wasn't particularly warm and the meat was kind of tough.  The tzatziki was fine, but thought it was a little weird to be on the side.

The service was good and patient, but the lame decision to combine two different kind of tables (when we suggested moving and pushing several squares together) knocks them down a little bit.  Though not as much as the not good gyro.  Probably closed to a 2.5, but rounded down to 2.",review,XpejQYZqVcYGX7fYuYHzSw,0,0,0

We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.

After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.  

We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!

 On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos). 

After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to ""stop harassing the fish."" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to ""harass"" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too).

It would have been nice to be able to hear the game over the discordant pop rock music at a mexican establishment but I understand that you are not a ""sports bar"". It was Monday night and with the exception of a large group  of blue hairs celebrating secretary's day the place was empty.  The bar area managed to fill up, because the Cardinals were on tv and it seemed as thought the high tops and patio were busy as well. 

Our bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to up sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails. You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was doing her best nothing a little training and experience can't fix. The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long though being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars go though to develop new and unique cocktails.  We ordered the pumpkin margarita. I applaud the attempt but personally it tasted like puréed baby food. 

I was feeling very open minded and wanted to experience as much as I could that TQLA had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup.  

Queso dip: cold
Habanero dip: sweet with a swift kick afterwards: not bad
Guacamole: good: but was gone after 2 bites. I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of green shredded lettuce it will look like there is more than delivered. Fail

Chicken tortilla soup: Thick tomato soup with dry dark meat chicken chunks. Maybe it is just me but I prefer a more broth based ck tort soup and juicy white/dark meat chicken. Bleh: Amanda offered to remove it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry. My GF pushed hers to the side; DNF. 

Meanwhile; whilst experience our starters we managed without any silverware or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender on managed to become flooded with specialty cocktails in the well; thus not being able to properly oversee her patrons at the bar. Needles to say our drinks were empty, our plates, monkey dishes, empty bowl of chips, 2 cups of bland tortilla soup, saucers and wrinkled up black beverage napkins (used in the place of the real ones) were all tattering on the edge of the bar eagerly anticipating a bus boy to remove them. 

Onto the Entrees:

I ordered the carne Asada steak.  My girlfriend tried the habanero chicken platter. They were delivered by TQLA manager ""Joe"". Whom decidedly pulled himself from enjoying the football game to expedite some food. He crept up behind us and shuffled the entree platters in front of our faces after we spread our dirty dishes closer to the edge of the bar and politely stacked them for our ficticious busboy/girl to remove them properly. Now in my history with management; a decent manager would offer to remove the collection of dishes but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else since the look on our faces was disgust. Instead we opted to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with silverware and napkins.  He acknowledged that was a novel concept and proceeded to fetch us a pair. Joe wasn't six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food.  At this point my girlfriends temper got the best of her and she jumped up and retrieved her own silverware off of a table in front of Joe and eager waitress to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees. 

We dig in:  

Carne Asada: was tender but lacking the Wow factor. 

Habanero Chicken: Tasted like a chicken breast smothered in their warm fire roasted salsa... What happened to the habaneros?  Where is the heat...? Bland

I hope they get better: but until then Nandos all the way. Never saw Joe touch any tables, never offered to help out a bartender who was swimming laps in an Olympic size pool. Occasionally the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out.  This is about the time that our appetizers, chips, soups, and entrees were all removed from the bartop. FYI Joe, the hostess stand can hold itself up on its own. You don't have to stand there and hold it up.

This is another one of those places that thrives on the Groupon phenomenon. Prices are jacked up to accommodate a discount. I bought a $6.50 bottle of beer (as one example). My pizza, a sausage pie, came out burned. I know that a good pizza has a ""flame kissed"" look to it, even at top places like Bianco's. But this pie was flame-licked, and there's a difference. I tasted charcoal more than I did sausage. 

The folded and stuffed Calzone was not burned, but neither was it stuffed so full that it's busting its seams which is the way we like it. Lots of air inside this Calzone. I'lll take the dramatically less expensive Calzone at Mama Mia's on Indian School any day over this hot-air filled version.

This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.

It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received. 

I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant. 

It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should. 

Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.

We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point. 

To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.

We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in.  There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.

When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.  To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the ""look how good I was"" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.

We were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor.  He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink.  There is no drink menu on the menu.  No beer list, no soda list, no liquid period.  We asked to see the wine list, which had only bottle prices and doesn't even hint that they sell wine by the glass.  Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough.   The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna, the basics.  While we sat waiting for our meal, the salads came.  Weird...the menu didn't mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter.   More lack of information from the menu.

Now on to the decor.  It is terribly outdated.  Tacky, bland, pale paint scheme, brass fixtures, mirrors and cliche wine bottles.  There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed.  I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine.  I'm guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy.  I couldn't take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night.  This place needs a makeover, new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork.

The lasagna came.  It was OK at best.  I tried my fiance's chicken genevese at it was horrible.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me.  We did not take our leftovers.  We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious. 

We won't be back.  To be honest Oregano's lasagna is better by far.",review,9Nh6ae0UgBAMTwvfkuVqVA,0,0,1

Unfortunately, the day of my wedding was horrible.  My fault that I didn't go in for a practice run, BUT I was assured by their ANSWERING SERVICE that I would get ""one of their best,"" because that's who they send out.  The lady that came to our hotel room to do our (my mom and me) hair was rude and not talented.  She barely spoke and when she did it was defensive and not from a place of yes.  When a bridesmaid (who went to DryBar to get her hair done and wasn't satisfied) agreed with me that my hair style should be fixed, the stylist looked at her phone and said,""well, what time is it?"" as she argued with us that she couldn't do anything else with my hair because it's fine.  We were like ""we don't care what time it is, it's my wedding, and I will pay you whatever it takes to get my hair looking the way I want it.""  My mom hated her hair, took pictures to send to DryBar and then fixed it herself.  The problem with getting a quick solution is that they have an answering service which makes problem solving an issue, especially when you have limited time and makes scheduling a large group complicated.  Again, I've been happy once or twice, they have a few good stylists and a lot of very mediocre ones.  I think I'll try some of the other blowdry bars in town.",review,XJAtcMnQ1O7jTuFz3Kbpsg,0,5,0

A quick trip to the Yelp site quickly revealed the #1 restaurant in Tempe to be, in fact, a brewery. This delighted my boyfriend, a beer connoisseur, and me too, being a fan of highly rated restaurants and anything that makes my man happy. So we headed to the Four Peaks with high expectations and high spirits. Alas, our hopes were dashed almost from the beginning. 
The hostesses greeted us from the curb. They were extremely young and scantily clad in low, low, LOW slung jeans that did not cover their clearly illegal behinds. The place was crowded so we took a beacon and hit the bar for our first round. The bartender, despite a packed house, noticed us almost immediately and took our orders... the only quick service we received all night. The beers, well, the Kilt Lifter was a fine example of a 80 shilling Scottish ale... but the Raj IPA was heavy in diacetyls and but otherwise a reasonable attempt at an English IPA. Hopknot IPA was above average IPA with pleasing grapefruit aroma.
By the time we were seated we were happily woozy from the beers. Unfortunately, it took the bitch waitress nearly 20 minutes to take our orders and another 20 before our meals arrived. Food was decent, although side orders were botched... we DID notice the very nice disposable napkins, which were durable yet soft. Some of the nicest napkins I've ever seen of a disposable nature. 
Overall, a good people watching experience, very loud and crowded, with terrible service, adequate beer, and generic yet palatable cuisine. Would we go back? Not unless invited by good friends. Overrated.",review,q0IW1-twB0WY8UDtvt_zFQ,0,2,1

Some branches are better than others, some regions are better than others - they're no better or worse than other national chains which also have some good branches and some bad branches. I picked them because they have a great ""rewards program"" and because they have heavy presences in places where I travel often.

So this is a bad branch. There's a couple decent check-out kids, but in general their employees are among the worst trained I've ever seen, in terms of providing polite, timely, friendly customer service. They avoid your eyes when they see you looking for something in an aisle, lest you bother them with a question. They never EVER greet you with a smile and a ""good morning"" or a ""did you find everything you need?"" while you check out. They have inconsistent policies about whether or not coupons can be scanned from iPhone or paper copies needed (the manager basically called me a liar when I said checkout people have scanned my iPhone coupons many times in the past).

I was pretty excited for one of my favorite people to come and visit.  Her only request?  Sushi!  While I have my list of absolute AZ favorites (Tokyo Lobby, Toyama, Sakana, Hiro, Dozo) foolishly I decided we should try somewhere new.  Having read many good things about Hana, the choice was made.

Walking into the BYOB place with our Kirin Ichiban in hand, we were ready for a great evening.  Too bad that isn't what we experienced.  After being ignored for a few minutes by everyone who passed by and even the person behind the counter, I found someone to tell that there were two of us and we would like to sit at the sushi bar.  Although there were spots open, we were left standing there for quite a while.  Do you want to stand around holding a 6-pack and not even be offered a bottle opener?  Me neither.  Once we were finally seated, we weren't told about any specials, offered water or even glasses for our beer.  

Deciding to make the best of it, we ordered:
Yellowtail sashimi (good, the best item we had)
Spicy scallop nigiri (good)
Albacore sashimi (dry, not sliced through, leaving us top pick off overcooked bits and pieces)
Freshwater eel nigiri (dry and crumbly rice, falling apart at the touch)
Scallop dynamite ($15+ for 'krab'?  Really?)

The female sushi chef was nice but our waitress was nonexistent.  Other tables and customers at the sushi bar seemed to be getting decent service (water, getting their beer/wine/whatever from the refrigerator) but we were left without water refills (once we finally got any at all) and don't even think about getting another of those BYOB beers we brought.

Lets get this out of the way and on the table first, this ws not a bad place to go, but, it wasnt my favorite by any means.  I went in expecting to pay a lot for the meal, and rightfully expected the best food I have ever had, and that was just NOT the case.  From the high prices to the limited menu, I would expect this place to specialize in the particular menu items, and would hope to have my taste buds dancing while I shout for more.  I didnt.

We started the meal with burratta forno cotto mozzarella.  it consists of oven baked burrata mozzarella served with grilled ciabatta, fried eggplant, lemon-truffle vinaigrette and parsley.  There were only two tiny ciabatta slices which was not the first complaint.  the second complaint would be that the fried eggplant could have used a bit more flavor.  (perhaps a little lemon pepper in the batter would have done some good) Lastly, the dish could have satisfied by just having a bit more cheese.  This dish was not bad by any means, just expected a bit more with the $12 price of two miniature slices of ciabatta and two thinly sliced pieces of eggplant.

on to the salad.  I dont know about you, but, when I order a salad, I expect a salad.  this was a salad, just not with any lettuce or salad look.  we ordered the caprese di pomodoro.  this dish is made with heirloom tomatoes, preserved lemon, herbs, fresh burrata mozzarella and extra virgin olive oil.  from the description, i assumed, dont ever assume, that this was going to have some spring mix as a salad base, then have the tomatoes witih cheese and basil, and then the lemon with olive oil as a dressing.  WRONG.  it was nothing more than what the description said.  it was two tomatoes cut in half, with a small amount of cheese and a few basil leaves and then the lemon preserve mixed with the olive oil on top.  dont get me wrong, this ws absolutely AMAZING, and I would love to have it again.  It is just not what I expected, so, it would have been nice to know what exactly I was ordering for $10.

To make matters worse, our so called salad took about 30 minutes to make its way to the table after putting in the order.  it took so long that the chef actually apologized and told management that he was going to send out a soup for us for the wait.  we were fine and in no rush, but, when we were already having our food take forever and told we were going to get soup, we expected it.  the soup never came.

finally, after waiting for and hour and a half for our main entree, we got our food.  it was good, but, nothing to write home about.  my pollo portofino was bland to say the least, and was actually a little dry.  the potatoes were decent, but again, a bit bland.

my date got the ravioli di mozzarella con salsa all'arrabbiata.  the ravioli pasta was so thick that you really couldnt taste the filling, and the sauce was to sweet in my and my date's opinion.

we however did order a side of the risotto parmigiano, and this was just amazing.  I am very happy that the recipe was on a poast card that came with the bill.  I will be making this at home in the coming week.

for dessert, we ordered pistachio gelato.  it was the best gelato I have ever had.

when it comes to a decision of returning to Alto, it will not be high on my list due to being over priced for what you get and all around, just not the best first experience.  I will however think of stopping in to get some risotto or gelato to go.

when it comes to good Italian, I think I will be sticking with Italian Gratto or Pane e Vino.",review,g8up_FWF-A5JQjuUJ_VsWw,0,1,0

The soup was ok (bland, but ok), the sandwich was...well, kind of sad looking. A big dark green piece of wilted lettuce, barely any of the 'cranberry mayo' or whatever was supposed to be the mayo on there, the turkey and ham tasted great...there just wasn't very much of it, and they completely forgot my request for a side of mayo, mustard and a knife/fork on a triangle cut piece of wheat bread. I wasn't able to choose my chips, so ended up with some plain ones and my cookie was undercooked by about 10 minutes. The outer circle was baked, but the rest was cookie moosh. (Which is fine when you are in a cookie dough mood, but alas...I was not.) The lemonade was FANTASTIC though.

Let's move on to the cheese crisp, which had plenty of grease cascading off the pieces, and virtually no ""crisp."" Did you put some cheese on a tortilla and microwave it? 'Cause I could have done that at home.

Both drinks were quite tasty- my tea was strong like I like it, but not bitter. Hubby's lemonade was very good, but he drank it so fast I didn't get a chance to steal many sips.

Yes, the pork was very tender, but the salt was -shall I put it nicely?- aggressive. Sam Kinneson aggressive. The ""tortilla"" was an inedible science experiment. Thick and doughy, and made even more appetizing by the charred side, it reminded me of the salt play dough we all made as kids, formed into a pancake. Truly nasty.

I've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.

We ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.

The first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.

Less critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty.

The guy came over and said ""Oh, I have another one in the box"" and grabbed the one in my husband hands and walked off never to be seen again.

I felt bad for the guy at the register because it wasn't his fault and he apologized but that doesn't give the guy running a section the right to decide what customer is more important and that is what he did.  New customers should never be treated any differently and to basically make a statement of you are not important enough was the final straw.

After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the ""OPEN"" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected ""Butai"").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said ""We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..."" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  

When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  

I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.

I have had their tacos and enchiladas and prefer Arriba's (right next door) or Carlos O'briens, just down the street. There is even some mom and pop place by my apartments that equates to the quality and taste. 

What I like about Los Olivos is their Nachos. OMG this thing is huge. Imagine a large pizza in your head and then replace that image with the same size plate of nachos. I am not even kidding. Four or more people could munch on this. They do it exactly how I like it too, lots of cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole. YUM 

That is what has been keeping me coming back, but after the other night I feel I am sure to find somewhere whose nachos make me just as happy. 

Every time I have been here, it has been dead. And last time I came at prime dinner time. Then why is the service so awful? This kid kept coming up to our table and trying to take things. We weren't even half way done with our nachos when he asked while I'm in MID BITE ""are you finished with that"" not only asking but reaching his hand to grab the plate! And this happened repeatedly as we tried to finish our food. I don't know if they wanted us out of there or what. And then for someone who was so ""attentive"" I waited for 5-10 minutes for a drink refill (make the glasses clear and it won't be so hard to tell if I need more) 

My friend and I left full but irritated. If I thought the quality of service was a one time thing I wouldn't even put this review up...but the fact of the matter is when you are paying for overpriced Mexican food in North Scottsdale, it isn't as if your options are slim.

The location is somewhat good but stinks if you get stuck behind the train since it is just south of the train tracks. The shuttle are fairly frequent and prices reasonable.

It took me a while to get over that fact and give it a decent try.  Among the things Delux has copied from FO is the famous ""Office Burger,"" which Delux calls the ""Delux Burger.""  They also bring out the fries in a shopping cart just like Father's Office.  What Delux fails to copy, however, is the quality of the food and the high-end nature of the original.  At FO, the wines changed weekly and are all incredibly rare selections.  The beers at FO also tend towards the more obscure.  Delux seems to concentrate almost exclusively on beers and does have a decent selection, but nothing you can't find elsewhere.  Wines are available, but as an afterthought, and definitely not of the quality served at FO.  For Phoenicians who never experienced the joys associated with the original Father's Office, you're missing out.  It's like being an Eric Clapton fan but not even knowing who Muddy Waters is.  But all the imitation aside, I have to say that Delux does a pretty good job with everything and they have taken the FO concept and adapted it to the PHX strip mall environment.  

Food wise, everything I have tried was ok.  They did change their sweet potato fries a year or two ago because the other ones weren't ""crispy"" enough.  The problem is that these new crispier ones have no flavor.  When they were testing out the new fries, the manager asked me and a friend to opine and we told him the truth: We said the new ones are flavorless.  I guess we were the only ones who thought so because they went ahead with that change.  That lost them 1 star from this review.  I would rather have the soggier more flavorful ones (who knows how they make these new ones so crispy anyways?).  

When I go here, it's almost always out of convenience and late at night.  Not many places of this caliber stay open until 2 am, so it's about all there is when you are in need of a late night meal in this part of town.  Their 2 star rating is based on: clearly knocking off one of my favorite places, Father's Office (minus 1 star) and for ignoring my feedback on the new crispy tasteless sweet potato fries (minus 1 star).

*  There was no cottage cheese.  (They don't always have it, but at these prices they should have some today.)

*  There was turkey, but breast meat only & no dressing!

Why are the tables so big if the food is so small?

We entered into a brightly painted orange restaurant and stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes waiting for the hostess to finish flirting with the server and notice us.  She clearly didn't want to be there and could care less where we sat, so opted for the table in the window.  

We sat and waited and waited and waited.  Tables that were sat after us already had their drinks and they were not busy.  Finally I tried to get the attention of the hostess who was standing half asleep at the hostess stand, mouth open wide, eyes half closed.  A few minutes later we finally had a server.

Our server was not very friendly.  I don't even think she said good morning.  We ordered.  Tables sat after us already got their food and we finally got our drinks.  She bought out 2 cups of coffee, but I did not order coffee so I made her take that back. 

Our food finally arrived.  We ordered french toast which came with strawberries, bananas and a cinnamon sauce, eggs benedict with crab cakes and two orders of country potatoes. 

Breakfast was pretty good.  I enjoyed my crab cake and the cinnamon sauce on the french toast was a nice added touch.  The potatoes were not good, they had WAY too much pepper on them, I couldn't even eat them.  Gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup.

We never saw our server again.  We got a water refilled after we finished our meal.  AND THE WAIT BEGAN.  We waited and waited and waited for our check.  Tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food.  We never saw our waitress. I guess we were her only table, if not I felt bad for her other tables as well. 

Finally some guy brought us our check and tried to drop it off and run, I said WAIT and gave him my card and said, ""If I don't give this to you now it may be 20 more minutes before we see someone again""

Because I didn't look at the bill first when he brought it back I didn't notice until after I paid that they charged me $12.05 for the eggs benedict when their menu actually said $10.50.  I didn't say anything...  I just left a sad tip.

We were there for OVER an hour, they had lots of empty tables, and we only saw our server once.

Gary and I always over tip, because he and his family owned restaurants in the Valley for 35 years.  He has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables.  We know that when food comes out wrong, it's probably not the servers fault, and things happen, so we still tip well.  TODAY, I felt like we were invisible and I have no idea where our server disappeared to for the hour.  

We drove by Over Easy, La Grande Orange and IHOP to try this place.  We probably will not be back... unless we decide to give it a second try on jazz night... I do love jazz.",review,Wy7f9DOuBEOenhnA7KIKoQ,1,6,0

Don't get me wrong, I still love JFG; I just didn't care for its BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries.  The coleslaw was good, but not so fantastic that it's worth the pain after.  I thought that the pork had too much of the cloyingly-sweet sauce.  Wasn't so sweet when paired w/ the garlic toast points.  However, if you look at the included photo, you'll see that the two pieces of bread were under the pork, and therefore completely saturated w/ sauce.  I like accompanying bread to be crispy/crusty (love that crunch!), so all I had to enjoy that afternoon w/ the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauced meat!  What a waste (tsk, tsk)!  The boat of fries was just a complete soggy mess.  I should've asked them to sub sweet potato fries instead, but why must I pay extra to get a perfectly crisped product?  Then again, one (wo)man's treasure is another (wo)man's trash, and vice-versa, eh?

Before seating us at a LARGE table (there's maybe 10 tables in this joint), this obviously inexperienced hostess first looked unsure of where she should seat us (the table for 2 or for 4?) She then proceeded to rearrange the table for 4, and moved ALL of the chairs around the table to add 1, instead of just adding it to the empty space on the end of the table.... odd.

And then our waitress.... was really abrupt and ungracious about things. My sister's accompanying salad was half covered in lettuce rust - and when she showed the waitress, all she said was ""so do you want it?"" Uhm, no thank you, I like my food fresh, not rotten, but thanks.

The sushi was pretty much the same thing covered in different sauces. Annnd they were pricey. it was kinda sorta really unbelievably ridiculous. RIDICULOUS, i tell you! Not worth it. No way. I'm quite sure that the ""crab"" was imitation. And the fish wasn't even that fresh. Granted, we're in the middle of a desert, but still. 

The one redeeming quality of this place? The ramen. Although there were about 10 noodles in it, the pork was perfectly cooked. And it would have been nice if the chef had been a little less stingy with the ramen noodles. 

Would I come back? Uhm.... only if I had no choice and was craving ramen. But for sushi? Save your money, go to Yen and get muuuuch better quality AND quantity.",review,jqs0xPGhZwlyijqWLEgRyg,3,5,0

I got the Shrimp & Pork Spring Rolls and the Pho (which they call Beef Noodles I believe).  

My first impression unfortunately when the app came out was that the Spring Rolls used iceberg lettuce instead of basil or mint or a more dark green leafy green.  The iceberg lettuce gave the Spring Rolls a cheaper feel that I didn't really enjoy.

The Pho was better though they seemed quite stingy on the accoutrement, as I got two jalapeno slices and a sorry looking stem of basil.  In addition, the thin slices of beef were definitely overcooked and tasted not unlike a sponge.

Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why.

My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.

This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said ""sorry""  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.

Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says ""This is your order, this is what you have"" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says ""ssssshhhhhh"" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?

Now don't get me wrong, I like Thai Basil.  The food is decent and the interior is nice, but the tables/diners seem to be squished elbow-to-elbow New York style. Spartan, but slightly upscale, this restaurant ALWAYS seems to have a wait.  

The yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut, spice, carrots chicken and potatoes.  I can't ever seem to get enough, and I really mean that.  The portions here are small, and while lunch portions are expectedly small, portions elsewhere (at Chanpen Thai, for example) are larger and less expensive. Elsewhere the Thai BBQ chicken comes with 1/2 a chicken, but at Thai Basil they give you three lonely strips like cheapos!  The massaman curry and pad thai are pretty good too, but I feel they're just OK.  I've had better.

Service is hit or miss here.  One thing that's consistent: they always seem to be understaffed. Once when I was dining alone (at a 4-person table) they had the nerve to ask me to move while in the middle of eating, to a 2-person table.

First off Lucille's has a good location.  Its located by Dave and Buster in the Tempe Marketplace.  The look of the place is gimmicky but in a Famous Dave's kinda way.  They have old school signs, mason jars to drink out of, and all the little fake things to make you seem like you have gone to Memphis or where ever they are trying to transport you.

The service was absolutely awful.  It took way to long to get drinks and even longer to get refills.  Attitude the whole time.  Here is a tip if you want a good tip bust your butt.  Then you will have more money to pay for your tuition (half the staff is college kids).  And do not roll your eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions.  They tell you they smoke all their meats in house im not impressed.  

Now onto the most important part the BBQ.  We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries. 

The chicken was good.  It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints.  The portion size was good.

Brisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork.  That tough.  Maybe over smoked?  Portion size tiny.  4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long.

Rib Tips were dry and covered in sauce.  Hardly any meat on them.  Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat.  But not this place.  You get a scoop full.  Boo.

Collard greens were disgusting.  Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter.  Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right!

Sweet Potato Fries.  You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen.  So I would recommend these over regular fries.

The starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird.  WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter. 

One last thing the house and spicy BBQ sauce's main ingredients are CORN SYRUP thats how they thicken it! seriously that should tell you something.

Overall two thumbs down.  Stay away there are plenty of other great BBQ spots in the valley.",review,JnRT9i2d71pY8D8ngzCz9Q,0,1,0

Complimentary valet..(you can't park anywhere in the neighborhood). I ordered the Blood Orange Bellini and it was not your typical bellini..not frozen and frothy. It was champagne in a flute with a sugarcube dropped in. Still good, but not what one would expect..just an FYI. I had the Caprese salad and the Mozz was not served ""classically"". Cold and sliced in rounds or in balls. It looked like marshmallow fluff and was kind of tangy. I was almost sure I was eating something that may have gone bad. I do not recommend to any Caprese lovers. However, the Organic Chicken with pan seared gnocchi was fantastic. Granted i asked them to add some spice for fear it might be bland.. Spiced it was perfect and Im glad because it probably would have been a bit too bland for me. My dinner date had their signature Pappardelle and that was excellent as well, although a bit soupy which made it messy.

I stopped in recently with a friend when  in the area and Roka seemed less than lively. Our guess that this place might be more lively was perhaps correct, in that it had 6 people at the bar rather than 4 and had about 30 flat screen TV's running baseball games and various other sporting events. We chose to sit at the bar, because I always think you get better service there and the restaurant itself was pretty slow at 730 on a weeknight. That thing about better service didn't really hold up here as it seemed out bartender was also handling issues around the restaurant and after I finished my first glass of wine the glass sat empty for quite some time before someone came by to see about a refill. I will tolerate just about anything as long as I have a cocktail in front of me, and as pouring drinks is the primary function of a bartender this was more than slightly annoying. 

We ordered the ahi appetizer for a starter (I know I should probably be slapped for even ordering something like this in a sports bar). I had a couple bites and they were okay, but parts of the fish were actually starting to grey, which can't be a good sign. For dinner we had the salmon and a flatbread. 

Both the bartenders on duty raved about the flatbreads. I believe they have never eaten a flatbread anywhere else or they probably would stop raving about these. It was a relatively flavorless bread, which was not at all crisp on the bottom or the edges, lightly topped with cheese, sauce and some bits of chicken. It was edible as a food dish, but the part I found off putting was that the bread seemed to be taking on the flavor of the wooden paddle it was served upon. Yes, I know you can cook bread over wood and it will take on the wood flavor, but I am 99% sure this was coming off the wooden serving board. I actually took most of it home and the taste went away by the next day and the whole thing was well served by about 5 minutes in the toaster oven.  

The salmon was also very very okay. The best thing I  think we ate was the broccoli side that came out with the fish. They were sharp green, flavorful and cooked perfectly. The fish was kind of overdone and uninteresting. I feel like maybe this place should go to a smaller menu to be able to have more consistency with preparation.",review,mE2ll6yfwUvy-W7To3E0AQ,1,2,1

We were craving flavorful salsa and well-spiced meat dishes after a long, warm day in the desert. What we found here was slightly different than we were expecting......The chips were made of corn AND flour tortillas, which was a nice surprise but way too filling while waiting for our food. The salsa was just fresh tomatoes with some cilantro (or maybe even parsley?) for color.
It was ""Taco Tuesday"", which here meant all-you-can-eat of crunchy or soft with 3 different filling choices.""Hamburger Helper-esque flavored shredded beef tacos"", according to my teen son. Ooops :( I ordered the ""award-winning green chili sweet tamale"". I fear they left the winners with the judges, for they didn't make it to my table.

I woke up as sad and disappointed as I felt last night, leaving the legendary, old school Durant's after an evening of less than mediocre food and terrible service. Sigh.

Honey had a great lunch there a few months back and was excited to impress me with dinner. We saw Durant's listed on Restaurant week and were excited for the excuse to squeeze into one of their comfy booths amidst the bow-tie clad staff and velvet wallpaper. The instant time travel type setting usually makes for an incredible dining experience. Shall I fault the poor rating to their efforts at succumbing to a prix-fixe menu? Perhaps.

Our time at the bar proved to be the best part of the night. Watching the bartender mix the martini's the way my Pops used to was nostalgia at its best. I LOVED that they serve bottles of beer with a toothpick of meat and cheese. That is brilliant. It could transform me into a beer drinker after all. We met up with friends and continued on to the dinner portion of the evening.

Moving on to the booth, our waitress was definitely in the weeds. Having been in her shoes before, I always try and accommodate the situation. We ordered an appetizer and a few cocktails and waited to order dinner when she seemed able. Appetizer of artichoke dip was yummy. Tortillas and garlic bread and warm, cheesy dip delivered promise.

The limited menu was just that. Okay first course salad/soup options. Main course offered Pot roast, a small steak or chicken fried steak. Stewed steak, grilled steak or fried steak. Really? Your menu is impressive...if you really don't want to participate in Restaurant week, then don't. 

Honey ordered the chicken fried steak as a continuation of the old school vibe. I ordered the trout off the regular menu after C pointed out the fish option. J ordered the cfs too. 

Food took a bit, but we had good conversation flowing, so it wasn't a problem. Salads and soup were fine. Main course arrived and we were all a bit surprised by the size of the fried steak. I guess when you think of this meal from the past, it encompasses half the plate and is oozing with country gravy. This steak was the size of a burger and had a dollop of thick gravy-esque goo on the top. Garlic mashers were appropriately placed. 

My trout was supposed to be topped with a lemon caper sauce but instead it was slathered with a gravy that hinted at lemon and was all wrong for a fish. The trout was pain-fried and should there have been a light sauce, it would have been good. But the fried fish with the gravy was just so not good. 

The fried steak too, so not good. Mashers achieved an appropriate level of goodness, but you really don't want mashed potatoes to lead your dinner. 

We were devastated. 
The whole experience was so not what we came for or expected. I do want to give Durant's another chance and order a big, juicy steak and let them wow me like they do to so many, but it will be a while before our trek downtown includes a walk through their kitchen.",review,IQTk7FS2EF657T8wJqr-sw,1,3,0

I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class. 

I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.

The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before.

First, I called Fry's Electronics to check to see if they had a specific GPS model that worked in Europe. I called because I live at 115th Ave and Buckeye which is about 20miles from the nearest store. The call center informed me they did not carry that model but listed about 10 other GPS with maps of Europe. I asked again those models have maps of Europe? ""Yes and Australia too"". And you have those models in stock? ""Yes."" What is the price range? ""$100 to $300"". Thank you. FIRST MISINFORMATION! 

So I drove to  30th Ave and Thunderbird, talked with ""GPS Specialist"" (which apparently means nothing) and he (Jared) informed me they did not have any GPS units with European maps!! He said the call center ""is a bunch of retards"" and that those were all last years models. 

Then he called someone and looked at several GPS Units. When he did not know  if the unit had European maps or not he GOOGLED them! (okay not confident in your product knowledge). Then he sold me a $260 unit with European maps. SECOND MISINFORMATION. 

I drove all the way home and the GPS did not have European maps! I had to buy them for another $100 which I could have done with a cheaper GPS.

So I drive back to Fry's. Speak with a Supervisor, they return my first GPS. I speak with the same sales rep (ya thats great). He says he figured out 25min after I left that he sold me the wrong product and none of their GPS have european maps. 

So I then buy the cheapest model that was could download European maps, according the the sales rep Garmin NUVI 50Lm for $129.  THIRD MISINFORMATION. Because according to the Garmin site the NUVI 40Lm is also compatible and cheaper. 

I then went home bought the $100 European map and couldn't download it to my GPS because there wasn't enough space available!!!

As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.

We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.

The sauce was very runny, and the vegetables were soggy and looked they had been sitting in the sauce for quite a while.

The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio. Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables. I really thought I was in for a great evening. Oh how wrong I was.

My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door. Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available, I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair. I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didn't want *that* table, the hostess led us to the back. It's not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening, it was just weird.

We sat and were greeted by our waitress, who initially seemed very nice. We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu. Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu. It's just so small that I missed it the first time. She told me that Friday night is the $4 frozen house margarita night, so I went with her suggestion. By the time I finish pulling out my ID, my dining partner was ready to order. We got a queso appetizer, the vegetarian tacos with a side salad, and the machaca plate.

While we waited, a few more groups came in, were greeted, and received their adult beverages. It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink, so I tried to look for our waitress. 

She finally popped up five minutes later, but avoided all eye contact with our table. When she did see me, she quickly ran outside. I understand she might have had a few tables outside, but why have an inside section to wait as well? The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled. (Margarita was still MIA at this point.)

Then, the queso came out, brought by two hipsters. It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad. My friend tried to make the best out of the situation, but I was ready to call the manager. I really, really regret that I did not. 

Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found. AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items. (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita, it was still MIA.)

Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was. My friend cut me off and said it was different, but okay. He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware. The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.  When she came back, I asked about my drink.

With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence, she finally brought me my drink. It was OKAY, not worth $4... more like $2-3. 

Two seconds later, the food came out. At least we had silverware?

1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay. Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white, iceberg lettuce salad?
2) My friend's machaca was bone dry. Isn't machaca supposed to be tender, rehydrated, and edible? 

All in all, the salsa was the best part of the meal. Yet, one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone. This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto.",review,eAgcqq8MAe1ztS4gqDbpTA,0,3,2

What I don't get is the awful food. This was my FIRST (and last) visit into this franchise restaurant. How they convinced franchisees and the general public to invest and vote with hard earned dollars is beyond me.

I took my friends 11 year old there after he played in a b'ball game and after looking at the menu and pricing decided to split the rib eye special $19.99. 

I got the fried pickle appetizer as well and was sorely disappointed in the batter and both of the ""dipping sauces"" (watery ranch and thousand island? I really couldn't tell).  Even a franchise like H***ers makes them WAY better......wow.

On to the main course. The baked potato with butter and cream cheese was overcooked or something? I have never had a potato that seemed to have been soaked in some type of brine and then baked? Kind of par boiled or something. Anyway the color was greyish and the taste like that of a fishy sea salt.

Moving to the broccoli i was greeted by a palor yellow looking presentation. I couldn't tell if it was cheesy cauliflower or ? Wow the taste was again that of something really overcooked or under matured...YICK

The last chance at redemption came with the medium well rib eye. Good sized portion and easily split between the two of us 20oz. Good wholesome beefy taste and great texture only to be squallored  by a heavy Saltiness....not sure where this was picked up from but maybe by hanging out too close to the potato? 

I really am normally an amicable restaurant patron but after forking over $46 including tip for two to split some food and getting served what we did ...well you get my drift.

The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.  

This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.

The short: Open and clean setup with friendly staff, but it's basically just-ok carby kid food.

The long: On the south side of Thomas, just west of 44th St., turning left into the lot can be a bear during peak traffic, but it's otherwise fairly accessible for people driving in from the west or walking up, like I did. The inside is wide open and clean with plenty of chairs and tables that were just a little too cluttered around the restaurant floor plan. Otherwise, it doesn't stick out much from other fast food joints. I went during the middle of a somewhat busy lunch period, and who seemed to be the head cashier loudly greeted just about everyone who walked in the front door on the other side of the restaurant. My cashier was friendly and quick, though he seemed a tiny bit frazzled by the small rush. 

I ordered The Box combo and a lemonade to go and headed back to my office a short 5-minute walk away. I hoped the freshly squeeze lemonade would be awesome, even if they did charge only about a dime more than fountain drinks for a regular. Although I could taste the lemon, the drink was so sweet, it may as well have been from a mix or carton. The Box comes with a small container of sweet coleslaw dressed in a lot of mayo, a slab of soft-in-the-inside, perfectly browned-on-the-outside toast, somewhat slightly crisp, thin crinkle cut fries, a container of Cane sauce (which tastes like burger sauce), and, of course, four chicken strips. Unless you're me and you get only three chicken strips . . . or two smallish chicken strips and one big chicken strip that maybe they counted as two, but really, halfway through the meal, you're so carbed-out full that you don't miss anything aside from the extra dollar you paid for that extra chicken strip. The strips were fine. It was real chicken, and true to advertising, it was fresh. Sort of crispy, but not as crispy as I'd hoped, or even expected. Tender and moist enough to not be bad. But not special. All of it was pretty one-note. I can't even tell you what part of the meal I liked best . . . maybe the toast. Coincidentally, every time I took a bite of that toast, I'd think, ""This is the most random slice of toast ever. What's it even doing here?"" 

So, it's fine if you're like me and want to try every new eatery that opens near my home or office and appreciate the novelty of places like this, but personally, I won't be making a return visit.

The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking, the cleaning, the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe.

My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now, Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.

On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasn't).  I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast.

Wow.  I don't know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.  The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy).

Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish ""spicy,"" the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.  I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible.

I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee.",review,Y2-KtEL3k8Ai5gLzeIRX9w,5,4,4

There were plenty of people cooking and preparing the food, yet it all looked chaotic and unorganized.

Just as other people have mentioned, you can choose a whole array of toppings to customize your burger.  That capability is great as long as the cashier rings up your order correctly (which mine was not).  Needless to say I was less than thrilled that I had to battle the smoke so that I could re-explain to the counter staff how my meal was supposed to be prepared.

I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubster's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubster's getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok. 
This is a never return place for us. 
And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant.

When I set out to Yelp the Safeway across the street from me and the Mr.'s place I thought of using that word to describe how much I don't like this Safeway.  Of course it's warranted, they pissed me off!

Okay you know how they always do BOGOF on milk.. well me and the Mr don't drink that much milk so the cashier usually just gives me half off the 1 gallon. Well this time she forgot to and I didn't notice until I got home.. so seeing that I used to shop here once a week I figured Id just bring my receipt back the following week. Well the following week I went in and showed the receipt and the dumb bitch behind the counter was like, 'what am I supposed to do about it?'.. I explained to her what usually happens as the cashier gives it to me for half off.. she then proceeded to ask me which cashier was doing that, 'it's not our policy.'
After going back and forth for a few minutes I finally just told her to give me my 2 bucks.. she told me if I would have brought them the receipt back the same day they would have done something about it. Are you f-ing kidding me? Whats the difference besides my being inconvenienced having to drive back there. So I finally asked her if she was willing to lose a potential lifetime customer over 2 bucks? She responded, 'there's nothing I can do for you.' I then told her that her customer service skills suck and that I will NEVER return to the store. 

I guess never say never since I went into my very much disliked Safeway the other day. Believe it or not they make a pretty damn good sandwich and I despise Subway. So the 2 stars are for the yummy sandwich and the super cute guy who made it!

Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and you've got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebee's or TGI Friday's. 

I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity.

Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm. 

Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-4 or 4-5 pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 15 minutes of it. 

Bottom line is 5 pm's whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment.

Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least there's that.

Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price. 

Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Don't strain yourself, TGI Friday's. 

My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. We're talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect).  I'm also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce. 

Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise. 

Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh.

So what's that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Don't blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and you're in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I don't think I'm going to shell out 10-12 dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison. 

Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? That's a big middle finger right there.

Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling. 

I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing.

6059,e8FMAuTswDueAlLsNyLhcA,2012-06-18,iCDLG6a5zf9Z4RlZgt2B6Q,2,"I initially visited Daily Dose about a year ago after a night out.  I was only able to stomach some coffee and a few bites of breakfast nachos that morning, so I wanted to come back for a real (sober) meal.  Alas, they made a better impression on my first visit, headache and all.

My recent visit was on a Sunday, around 11:30am, and surprisingly there wasn't a line.  We had a 5 min wait though, so we helped ourselves to water & coffee from the pitchers outside.  When we were called to our table I was a little disappointed - the table was tiny and squeezed between the door to the front patio and a server's station - but I let it go.  My son knew he wanted a cheeseburger and I finally decided on the Ancho-chile corned beef sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Yes, this was going to be a cheat day!

Our waitress seemed.... off, and lacking personality.  She didn't take our menus after we'd ordered and there was no where to put them on the tiny table, so they ended up propped up against the window.  Same thing with our paper cups we'd brought in from outside - they sat next to the menus the whole meal.  The wait for our meals was a little long in my opinion - about 35 minutes.  During that time, our waitress was completely MIA and our drinks sat almost empty.  Thankfully, the guy who finally brought out our food was nice enough to refill them.  

So, I thought corned beef rubbed with ancho chili spice and topped with sauerkraut on rye was going to be a bomb of savory, tangy, spicy flavor!  But.... not, not at all.  What in the hell do you do to sauerkraut to make it BLAND?  How do you make these yummy ingredients just completely flat??  Frankly, I was PISSED I wasted so many calories on this sandwich.  I ate half because I was really hungry but didn't even bother to take the other half home.  On a more positive note, the sweet potato fries were excellent.

Feeling unfulfilled, I decided to try my son's cheeseburger.  Even though it was from the kid's menu, the burger was ENORMOUS and they sure didn't skimp on his fries either.  Sadly, the burger was also really under-seasoned and I honestly wondered if they'd seasoned it at all.  The pretzel-bread bun was the most flavorful part of the burger - it was yum!

About 15 minutes after our food came out, the waitress finally came by.  I asked her for a box (for my son's burger) and the check, which she brought to us at the speed of light.  I was very surprised to see I'd been charged $2.50 for a glass and a half of lukewarm, weak iced tea.  If I'd known that, I would've ordered a Tecate light for the same price.  Anyway, I got the distinct impression she wanted us to leave so her table could be re-seated with people who would drink and rack up a bigger bill.  Her loss, as I usually tip very generously when I'm out with my son. 

Overall, I was just totally bummed with Daily Dose's food, service, and value - and bummed my 100th Yelp review only deserves 2-stars.",review,fiyOnIEKBOgj00NJLwDBVg,7,9,9

My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all.

My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate. 

Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic!!)

I was there the very first day they were open and have been back three or four times since.  I waited to write my review until they had their ""grand opening"" and until they had gotten into the groove of having a market.

Boy, where do I start with the complaints?  The biggest complaint is not so much the hours but the DAYS that they are open.  Maybe I'm weird but I do my grocery shopping on Sunday.  We specifically didn't get a few things from F&E because we wanted the ones from the market.  I try and go Sunday but they are closed.  Try and go back Monday...they are closed.  At this point, I really need those items and I'm just going to buy them from a normal store.  It doesn't make any sense why you would have a ton of vendors there on Saturday dropping off their goods only to have them sit, locked up, until Tuesday.  If you need two days off, take Saturday and Wednesday off when the outdoor market is in full swing.

My next complaint is the selection.  I'm not even going to complain that you don't have basic things like fruit or butter.  I'm going to complain that you carry fish from Alaska (not local) and that you carry Shamrock milk! WTF! You could be carrying SuperFarm milk, butter, and ice cream but instead you carry the same thing Target has.  Try supporting real local business instead of mega-giant Shamrock Farms.

Finally, what's with the ""wine bar""?  Is it actually somewhere in the building or am I supposed to sit in the middle of the produce and drink?  It really feels like too much room was wasted on the sandwich/wine bar counter area and not enough was set aside for actual groceries.

I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.

However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)

So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.

When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.

The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.

As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.

A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.

The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.

If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area, go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St.(http://www.sonoraveterinaryspecialists.com/). It's also 24/7, but unlike VCA PVEAH, it is a truly valuable, legitimate facility, and it''s staffed by engaged, committed, deeply caring, and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel. At SVS, you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified.

VCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way. VCA is, in fact, the WORST of corporate animal service providers. The space is small, cheap, cramped, and the staff are indifferent at best and don't convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress. All they want is your money. They do NOTHING for the $99.75 they charge for an ""emergency exam."" We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate, literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody, traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication).  Furthermore, they tack on bogus surcharges ($5.25 for a ""biohazard waste fee"") that are irrelevant to the ""service"" provided, and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet, anyone?

Conversely, our (and our dog's) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency), and the cost was ultimately significantly less.

VCA is a money-grubbing, depressing, sham.",review,HLGREeWew_M4y4rw7MLLdg,0,0,0

Initial impressions were that Logan's is an imitation of one of my favorite family steakhouses, Texas Roadhouse. We go there every chance we can and have never been disappointed in the quality of food or service. 
Anyway back to Logan's, atmosphere was 'okay' (again a wannabe Texas Roadhouse but not quite right), service was fine, but once the food came, that 'sealed the deal' - very disappointing. Not that it was bad or anything, but the quality of the steaks just wasn't anywhere close to what you get at Texas Roadhouse, and when the prices are about the same, well, there's just no sense wasting time or money here. You might think I'm being rough but when all 3 of my kids (ages 7-11) say that they like Texas better, that's gotta say something (they usually never say anything bad - they usually just eat whats in front of them!)

I already voiced my complaint to the restaurant and to their website in writing, however I haven't received a phone call or email back.

I've visited this establishment twice and each time I go I receive very little toppings on my burrito or tacos. I understand that it's made to your order like Chiptole or Qdoba, but they'll add very little cheese or toppings on your food, which can cause you to request more. To save myself time and every yelpers eyes from reading this long story, the individual making my tacos was extremely frugal on the toppings on my tacos. She barely put any cheese on my 3 tacos and I simply requested that she could put a little more on the tacos. She did and when I went to pay for my order, I was charged an extra 95 cents for ""side cheese."" The issue isn't the money because eating at Cafe Rio can be expensive for a fast-food mexican restauant, but it's the principle of charging me extra after I said, ""can you please put a little more cheese on my taco."" 

This hasn't been the first time this happened, but a previous visit had the same result with the sauce on my burrito. I thought mexican food restaurants had gigantic burritos and generous size tacos, but Cafe Rio will charge you on top of your order if you don't like their skinny tacos.

All I ask for from Cafe Rio to acknowledge that when you add more toppings to what the cook's add to your food, that they say, ""this will be extra."" They do this at Chiptole and Qdoba, but Cafe Rio would rather screw you over at the end. 

I will not be visiting this establishment again. As I said, it's the principle as to why they charged me extra for this, not the money.",review,Ri2gusuEHm2kVuZ_YC-mkw,0,0,0

We walked in and were greeted by a strange, musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal.  We should have taken that as an indication of what was to come and left, but based on the great reviews, decided to stay.  Big mistake.

I ordered a red sangria which was okay, but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so I'm not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional.  We ordered the olives, fried potatoes, grilled zucchini, shisito peppers, and four different types of bruschetta.  The olives were, well, olives (tough to ruin those) but also contained some off-putting caperberries that we avoided.  The grilled zucchini was just plain zucchini with no seasoning whatsoever served with a side of what looked like potato salad as a dip, but we never really could identify what that substance was as it had absolutely no flavor so we opted to avoid the fat that it was obviously adding to the zucchini.  The shisito peppers had no spice or flavor at all and were absolutely swimming in oil.  I've never had a ""roasted"" pepper that was so soaked in grease.  The waitress asked if we didn't like the peppers when she noticed that all but a few remained and when we pointed out how greasy they were, politely took them off the bill.  The four pieces of bruschetta were all of different varieties: roasted eggplant; ripe tomatoes; avocado and beans; and grilled artichoke with cheese.  The bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor at all.  In fact, I think if I had just closed my eyes and randomly selected one off the plate, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell which it was.  The fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal, which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato.

The atmosphere was severely lacking as there were candles on all of the tables and numerous votives on the walls, but not a single one was lit.  The restroom was extremely dark and was absolutely filled with unlit votive candles so I'm not sure if this was an attempt at saving costs, but had I known this, I would have gladly spared a box of votives from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate.  The place is also incredibly tiny so I have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have spoken of would perform.  If anyone tried to move through there, they would literally be bumping into tables.

Anyways I am a vegan so asked about their vegan options. They said that pretty much everything was made with lard (I didnt know that people really still used that) but they said that they had a vegan burrito. I was assured that there wasnt any kind of un-vegan ingredients (such as cheese) in it. I ordered the vegan burrito with much skepticism. Once I got home and got about half way through the burrito I got a big mouth full of CHEESE!! 

I was so upset because I was assured that it was vegan and did not come with cheese. But even worse,  I think that they started putting cheese on the burrito and then realized that it was supposed to be the vegan burrito with no cheese and they just kind of picked what cheese they could off and left the cheese that they couldnt easily pick off on there. I am not positive thats what happened but im pretty sure.

Anyways aside from the fact that they REALLY messed up my order, the burrito was just okay. It was really pretty greasy. My fiance on the other hand seems to enjoy this place, he gave it 4 stars.

We first went to Chase which took all of ten minutes. The personal banker was great - in-out-done.  Then we headed to her Credit Union at approximately 10:00 AM. They were quite busy, apparently. When we checked in, I heard grumbling from other customers and asked the wait time.  I was told there were two people ahead of us in line and it ""shouldn't be long.""

30 minutes later, my mom went to ask how much longer it would take. Jennfer, who was manning the reception desk, dismissed her rudely in front of a lobby of customers. My mom is as sweet as tea in Tennesee, so to hear her called out in front of a lobby of people as a disruption was upsetting.  45 minutes later, I went up to ask if it would be much longer. Jennifer said curtly, ""We're busy."" Apparently, on Saturdays, they're busy and one should avoid transacting business there on the weekend. I don't recall being spoken to so rudely at even a fast food restaurant in recent years...

Another ten minutes or so went by (as did my deadline to make another appointment I had made), I was told it would be ""two more minutes"", as I had to go through their background check to be a member. They were having a difficult time with my Washington Driver License and the weird characters it has (an asterisk in part of the number). After all was said and done, over an hour later, I was approved to be a member and was successfully put as a signer on my mom's account.

I asked for Jennifer's card, as I told her I was not happy with the way she had spoken to me or my mother, and I intended to speak with her manager.  To that I received a reply she did not have one. The woman sitting next to her informed me she was the assistant manager and that they were busy on Saturdays. My biggest beef was this: If it was going to be an hour to speak with someone, tell me. I can make other arrangements or come in during the week. Being told first, ""It shouldn't be long,"" and then, ""We're busy"" is not an excuse. If the business is so overwhelming on Saturdays, perhaps it would be wise to staff more people, extend the hours, or inform people of the wait they're likely to experience because of the queue. Or don't open on Saturdays!

As a 20 year veteran of the service industry, I am very disappointed at the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union provided my mom and me, but also all the other people I watched be dismissed like the Credit Union was doing them a favor. After doing some searching for a new home for mom's money, she can get a much better rate at a (four letter word forthcoming) BANK!

Wow, I can not believe someone Yelp'ed PV. 
 My freshman year, my science teacher was arrested from embezzling from the strip joint she owned. We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore.
  The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom. 
Man, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After 2 years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon.
 They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus. 
 They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Gov't events,  that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it. 
 I remember making a video with Casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase ""come out of the closet"" and they thought the phrase might be offensive. Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didn't need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoo's for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.  I remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year, yet being subjected to 4 years of bullshit. I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie ""Pump Up the Volume"", which was filmed in the general area.
  When I quit the softball team, the coach/school councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again. When we took pictures for the badminton team, we didn't have enough uniforms for the entire team. 
 I felt like I was in some prison or some high security mental facility. In fact, when my mom visited the new campus, she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab, grey/blue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm. I never had a chemistry class. My two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about Shakespear, and another who said that ""The slaves did not have it so bad"".  My Biology book was so old, it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier, AND same friends mother warned me against my Biology teacher, Mr. H__. ""If he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself.. DON'T.""  
 
The Good Things I Remember -
 Mrs. Toal [sp?], a very good, and supportive, English teacher. Miss Lee, the best photography/video teacher ever and always had the best Halloween costumes. Hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the Horny Lady. Sneaking off campus to go to Barrows Pizza. My friends  wearing cut out Trojan condom boxes pinned to their shirt at the forced ""spirit assemblies"" and chanting our own spirit chant of ""Fuck you all we hope you die, that's the Trojan battle cry"".

 Time has a way of blurring the past, and making it less icky. Yet, my sister is a teacher at North Canyon, and a few years back I went and visited her on campus. The second I stepped into the main building, I felt sick to my stomach. Literally. 
 I hear they have made improvements since I graduated, and I hope so. I don't want my niece and nephew forced to survive another drone factory.",review,akmkd_2iLRrbOyPBfYLN0A,4,3,4

After looking at the menu online, I really wanted to like this place. The menu has some creativity to it, unlike the template-North-Indian-restaurant-menus you find at many of the Indian restaurants in the Valley. Aside from offering things like korma, kadai, vindaloo, etc. with a variety of options (chicken, lamb, paneer, shrimp or fish for each) they also have some other more unusual choices, like one of my favorite dishes, mattar malai methi (creamy fenugreek and peas). And dahi vada in the appetizers... I couldn't wait to check it out.
Unfortunately, three friends and I went at lunchtime on a Saturday - and there was a buffet. So I didn't get to try any of those tempting dishes.

The restaurant itself, while  decorated a little haphazardly (Chinese paintings?) is bright and clean. There's a TV on a wall, which happened to be playing one of my favorite Bollywood movies...so I was still excited about the place.

But...after tasting the food...meh.

The buffet was all right.. but nothing to write home about. Pluses? Once again, it had something different..fish curry as well as an Indian-style Chinese dish or two. So that was cool. But the food was just so-so. I was there fwith three other people - one of them said the cuts of meat, especially the chicken, were of higher quality than most Indian buffets. But he didn't like the sauces so much. One other friend said he liked the tikka masala, but that was about it.
As for the vegetarians, well, we didn't have a lot of choices. Veggie manchurian (which was pretty good), a very bland chana masala and some pea/carrot thing that reminded me more of baby food than anything else.
The dessert was just all right, too. And the rice was very bland.

So, overall, I wasn't impressed. But I don't want to judge the place too harshly based just on the buffet. After all, Curry House was packed on a Saturday afternoon, so I'm thinking maybe it's got something better to offer me..

I wanted something light and left feeling like I ate a ton of bricks.  My friend's scallops - she said they were ""okay"" and not better than that.

I live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.

Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.

They use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.  

The espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross

And finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. 

The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use. 
Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.

I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.  

Hundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.  AND I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.  

If you own a coffeeshop.  Coffee should be your passion.  
If you own a bait shop.  Fishing should be your passion.
If you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain (short, tall, grande), please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle.

I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said ""Regularly $140"". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140. 

Second, even though on the voucher it says ""PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK."" (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.

Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.

Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.

Good:  I can't get enough of the Cape Cod salad! It is really somethin' special, that ain't no lie.  Also the soup is always flavorful.

Bad: Has nothing to do with the food. It is all about the atmosphere, which is oppressive in an I'm-so-unique-and-talented-and-you-are-smelly-dung sort of way. Staff is pretentious and lazy. They think they must be pretty lofty individuals for working there but that doesn't mean they LIKE to work, for god's sake....  The owner. She is somewhat friendly, but beware. She is the person who created this environment, and it becomes easy to believe once she starts bragging about how well-off she is.  So congratulations everyone! We support these immature little weasels who scorn this gross human ritual we indulge ourselves in: being a customer, AND apparently we have made the owner a rich woman but shhhhhh! She's still the kewlest of the kewl.

UPDATE: Received an annoying email from the owner (the husband) who instructed me give "" *constructive criticism* "" and not make a personal attack or be petty. My review was neither of those things. I do not know John, nor do I know Carla. I only know what I experience when I have lunch at their place of business. The staff was rude and lazy. The owner DID brag. The food I always order is good. Get a grip buddy.

I was honest about my experience for OTHER PEOPLE who are considering spending their cash on food there.  I am not in the least concerned about the owners or the staff personally, but apparently John thinks I ought to be.  I ought to see how great Carla is. In fact, he goes into detail about how great Carla is.  It's nice to witness a man standing up for his lady. It would almost cause me to add a star up there, but sorry, no can do.  His improper use of the possessive apostrophe SEVERAL times canceled that out (okay, now that was petty -my bad).  

I'd advise John to concentrate on things other than trolling around yelp, chastising his own customers, whose business supports that fancy paint and the famously zombie-like staff.  Maybe the staff is just following John's lead when they don't focus on creating a positive experience for their customers?

Honestly, I remain puzzled as to why John would bother to bother me.  I go into a small restaurant to find the owner bragging. That is part of my experience and I will continue to post reviews featuring owners, and how they carry themselves.

As for the ""personal attack"" on Carla, I will not retract what I said just because John is butthurt and whines about it. I will say this: Carla has probably been in the restaurant several of the many times I have dined there, but I perceived the bragging only one time. I doubt anyone who read my review would label this person a braggart based on that one experience of mine, and as I said before- it did not and would not stop me from going back.

I don't know what hole in the wall ""amazing"" breakfast joint these reviews were for, but I must have been at the wrong place.........

Don't get me wrong this place is reasonably priced for your basic breakfast, but that is about it. I gave them an extra star for using ""local"" ingredients. This place is below Waffle House and the like on my list.

Aren't these people vegan?  Don't they hate the idea of poor little animals being our food (even though that is the only reason they are alive)?  Then why so much FAKE MEAT?!  

I will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have.  I go to a place like this to get a dish that uses vegetables in more creative ways, not to get some overly processed soy products that aren't nearly as healthy as fresh lean meats like chicken and fish.  FYI, I love meat but every once in a while I like to grab a vegetarian dish.  

Another negative is nearly everything is fried.  Guess they bust the myth that people are vegan because it is healthier.  Frying things is the cheap way out of actually creating a healthy AND tasty meal.  

I'll give them a 2.5 star because what we chose was quite tasty.  But with nearly every option involving faux meat and tofu it really is a disappointment.  If you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or Ethiopian places.  They are very creative and using spices to flavor a vegetable dish.

Yeah - it's a LOT of fried items. They even fry some of the shrimp in their salad items, i'm told. Hmmmmmmm. Bit overpriced for what you get. Some items are either smothered in gobs of soy sauce (duck breast), or have so little taste that they NEED the sauce (spring rolls - lay off the Anise!!). So....basically you're paying higher prices for gussied-up, MSG-ridden, fried nibbles - even if they ARE tapas. Funny how many people write reviews of this place stating that they were WASTED when they went...maybe because we naturally desire greasy food when we're drunk?

I've had friends go and love some items(lime mint beef, red curry tofu, miso) and dislike others (fried pork, gyoza, overcooked fried wontons). I've also had friends tell me they've seen everything from cooks picking food out of their teeth with their fingers behind the counter to death looks from Chu because they clicked their chopsticks together too loudly, or asked for their food to come out on time. It seems he's not the little ""darling"" that some make him out to be.

The music  (on some nights) can be occasionally good, but also gets repetitive and loud. Sometimes this place tries too hard to be New Yorkish - while existing in the remote patchwork of dirt lots making up the roosevelt district (or as some call it, ""Cenpho"". still looks like a lot of empty dirt lots to me).

And occasional HOUR wait times?! What is this: Matt's Big Shumai? It's small food! Get over it!

Looks like a lot of people ""need"" this place to be something it just isn't, for whatever reason. You are a fickle, mysterious and too often Lemming-esque crowd, my dear phoenix.",review,plNy9iRaTasckjl6Lb-zAA,2,3,4

Imagine:  A smaller Whole Foods meets IKEA.  Sounds interesting doesn't it?  Unfortunately they do not execute it very well.  There was nothing there that I couldn't get at Trader Joes at a lower price.  There wasn't any thing new or even different.  Sure you can get your Tide, Crest toothpaste and some other name brands there, but the place seemed to lack a soul.

If you need just one thing, this would be a good place to run in and out.  But if your looking to do the bulk of your shopping here...why not just go to Safeway? Maybe that's the point, but what really shocked me is that the prices here were not any better than Fry's or Safeway.  Trader Joes at least has really cheap prices and you know 90% your getting high quality stuff.  Plus TJ's is different from your normal shopping experience....the marketing is fun and the stuff you get there you generally cannot get anywhere else.  I did not sense any of this with Fresh and Easy.  It seemed sterile.

If you like F&E....good for you!!!   I just don't see the value nor the selection.  The idea of this place is great.  They just don't get the American market.",review,H7OGq5Upv2FwuSORESv6Kg,2,2,2

I'm a big fan of a good Italian Beef sandwich.  I was introduced to it when I lived in the Chicago area in 2001.  Since I've moved back to AZ, I am always in search of a good one.  Lately, on my way to Anaheim for a little family fun, I stop at Portillo's in Buena Park or Moreno Valley.  This is a must.  Needless to say this is what I compare Italian Beef sandwiches to.

The Italian Beef sandwich at Al's just did not compare.  Not only was the beef dry even though I got it wet, but it just tasted different.  It was definitely an unexpected taste for me.  The rest of the family agreed too.  The hype was there but did not deliver or meet my expectations for me.

To top it off, the service wasn't the best either.  It took a few times for the cashier to get the order right.  And even though the order was right they still managed to screw up one of the items we ordered.  Though they did rectify it.  And to top it off, we ordered a ""chopped"" salad.  The lettuce wasn't even chopped.  What?  Not chopped?  It's the little things.

On the day of the scheduled delivery, I got a call from the person I bought the pool table from, saying that Diamondback Billiards did not have my address or phone number and didn't know where to delivery the table (even though I was the one who set up the appointment and definitely gave my information during the phone call). So, I gave them my address, they showed up and set up and re-felted the pool table without incident. When I went to sign the invoice, I noticed that they even had my wrong last name on the invoice and had the seller's address listed as the Buyer and the Seller. I dont even know how this would happen except that the person I talked to when setting up the delivery was not doing his job. 

Also, I asked on the phone if they could bring an extra yard of fabric to cover a cue holder that I have and was told that it would not be a problem. And, you guessed it... the delivery guys knew nothing about it and didn't bring any. 

So, I went to the store the next week and asked if I could purchase a yard of the felt that they used to cover my table (I couldn't find a good color match at JoAnns). They told me that they would have to order it and it would cost $55. For a yard of felt.... yeah... that's nearly as much as I paid to have an 8 foot pool table covered. Needless to say, I didn't buy the fabric and I definitely will not use Diamondback Billiards for any of my billiard needs - too unorganized for my tastes. 

Also, when I was at the store I noticed that their selection of pool cues and other accessories is very limited. Unless you're in the area to go to Ikea, don't waste your time.",review,w1LjSa5wMexRIQ-82LKWmQ,0,1,0

If you know me well enough, you'll know my first thought when we walked in was ""is there booze???"" The answer is yes.

So you go in, scope out the menu, order at the counter, and they bring you your meal and beverages. I ordered a simple eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage breakfast, and my friend had an omelette. We had just had brunch at Maizie's the day prior and our first impression was disappointment in the portions of the food, considering the prices were also comparable. Oddly, my sausage, potatoes and sunny side eggs had the same consistency, so that was off for me. They were all a bit soft and soggy. We, of course, enjoyed the mimosa and bellini, but $5 each is a bit high considering they're $3 @ at other places, and Cafe Boa down the block offers unlimited mimosas for a fixed fee with food.

Though it seemed quite busy, I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival. Outside seating, despite a hot Arizona summer, was pretty nice with shade. However, this is where the pleasanties end.

Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.

The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later. Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner, it never came.

Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.

An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.

Slightly expensive, I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night.

I would give the service 1 star, but because a few of the dishes were very tasteful, I am giving two stars.  The waiter was nice, but did not belong in the service industry.  He called us ""dudes"" (I wasn't on the beach and he wasn't wearing swim trunks, no need for ""dude""), he kneeled on the table bench directly behind us, basically breathing down my neck when he talked (gross), never asked us how the food was, even when we didn't touch more than 2 pieces of the calamari (that was saturated in oil and desperately needed a few squeezes of lemon).  He took dishes away that we were not finished with.  

The food was good - some dishes were great and some were not good at all.  The romesco sauce served with the croquettas was delicious! I could have eaten just a side of the sauce alone.  It has just enough spice and the flavors were spot on.  The trout was another delicious dish.  The fish was cooked to perfection and everything on the plate hit the palette in all the right places.  

The calamari was awful.  It was over fried, and instead of serving with a lemon wedge, was served with a citrus aioli - the concept would have been great if worked with the dish. Even after taking the lemon from my water and squeezing on the dish, it was not appetizing.

If you check them out online and want to go try them for happy hour - sit at the bar (maybe on the patio, I didn't ask) but we were seated in the actual dining area and then told the HH menu was only available at the bar.  No biggie, but not the best way to attract repeat customers.  

The space itself is very nicely decorated, it was comfortable and had a lot of details that worked well with the rest of the decor.  

Overall, I think they did a great job with the space, if they tweaked just some small things with some of the food items, they could make them much better and as for service - contrary to popular belief, just because you're in Scottsdale, doesn't mean your staff should be wearing Ed Hardy t shirts and calling customers ""dude"".",review,8MgMRPw-e1M31uNdkdVlVg,0,3,1

I also don't especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. I'm not generally one for mushy, thick, ""natural"" fries of the sort served here. 

I can't help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 12 oz. drink cup. 

I would rank the burger places around mill as:
1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries
2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat
3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries

My husband, daughter and I went to eat at Joe's because we saw a menu in the Hotel where we were staying nearby.  The Menu mentioned that the TV show DINERS DRIVE-INS AND DIVES had done a show about the place and indicated the menu items that were highlighted on the show that were supposedly delicious!

I called ahead for directions and was greeted with an attitude when I explained that we were from out of town, staying at a hotel that has their menu and needed directions to get there.  I assumed since the menu was in the hotel room that the employees at Joe's  would know how to direct someone to get there from the hotel.  After I explained several times the cross streets and the name of the hotel where we were staying, explained that we were just north of the 202 freeway etc and was just about to give up, the girl finally was able to give me directions.  Was that an omen of things to come??

The first irritation that we encountered was standing in line and trying to decide what we should order while there was only ONE cashier.   So when we did reach the window to place our order we could practically feel the irritation of the people waiting behind us while we tried to ask a few questions about the menu.  Feeling pressure to hurry up by the impatient look on the cashiers face we ordered a variety of things for the three of us.  The Fontina Burger, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and Fresh Beet Salad.

With the variety of what we ordered you would think at least one of the three of us would taste something we liked, but the only adjective that we could come up with for everything was BLAH.  
I am not exaggerating....we were all hungry and we are not picky eaters, but we just couldn't get a good bite of anything.

Also when I placed our order I asked for side orders of the onions rings and sweet potato fries but the cashier rang up full orders which I didn't realize since my husband paid the bill not knowing it should have been less.  Our bill for the 3 of us was equal to what we would pay at a restaurant with someone serving us!!  I wouldn't mind so much if the food tasted good but......  
TheFONTINA BURGER was cooked very well done (I ordered it medium/well).  It had a very slight smear of pesto (so slight that I couldn't even taste it) with a few small pieces of mushy grilled pepper and the fontina cheese.  The burger was so unremarkable that I can't even remember if there were ""greens"" on it our not.  I would describe this burger as DRY and BLAH.
The ONION RINGS had such a crunchy exterior that it actually hurt our mouths to bite into them.  Besides that, the onion pieces were so thin you could hardly taste the onion.  It was like eating a basket full of crunchy fried breading.
The SWEET POTATO FRIES and the WHITE POTATO FRIES were also just BLAH....how can you mess up fries??  After some serious thought we decided it had to be the type of oil that they were fried in.  It was just tasteless.  Even salt and ketchup couldn't help these fries!  
The BBQ PORK SANDWICH was just okay as was the COLESLAW.  Not really much to say about them.  
The BEET SALAD tasted like dirt.  My daughter and I both love beets but neither of us could take more than one bite of this salad.
The PICKLES that they put on top of everything are just gross.  What they heck is wrong with just a dill pickle?  Why the sweet and sour wierd flavor combo??

There is only one DRINK MACHINE and CONDIMENT BAR and it is OUTSIDE!  So to fill your drink or get your napkins and ketchup you have to go out the door and stand in line then try to get back in the door while juggling everything.  Irritating!

More irriation came in the form of the FLIES swarming our table which made for a very frustrating time of swatting them off of our food between bites. 

We were all hungry but none of us finished our meal because we were just bored and frustrated trying to get a good bite.  We even tried to doctor stuff up by dipping our fries in the bbq sauce and adding ketchup to the burger but we just couldn't fix any of it!

We left feeling ripped off, vowed to never return and decided we deserved to stop for an ice cream someplace on our way back to the hotel to get that IRRITATING, BLAH, SWEET and SOUR, DIRT flavor out of our mouths.

PAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS would be my recommdendation to the staff of this place because everything really adds up or takes away from the dining experience.  We were overcharged, irritated by the set up, atmosphere and flies and we were still hungry when we left!  

I am submitting this review because I don't want other people who have never eaten here before to be fooled by the FOOD NETWORK show hype the way we were.

It's probably one of the most beautifully laid out and convenient movie houses I've been in. And for the first several visits, I didn't have too much of a bad experience. In fact, the only thing wrong was the ticket machines outside were down - apparently, I've heard that happens a lot, if they've ever worked.

This last trip was just plain bad. I went to see Piranha 3D and the 3D screen was fairly small, especially for a wide release on opening night. The 3D was off a bit, but then that might be this old person's eyes; I could see shadows and lines behind some of the target objects.

I arrived 45 minutes early and I mistakenly thought I would be too late to get a good seat for a 6:30 PM showing. By all means, I was approximately 30 minutes too early. They booked the showings way too close. The previous showing's credits ran until about 6:10, and then they, as always, took their time to clean out the theater. Once in, finally, the theatre was almost pitch black aside from dim lights on the staircases. The Pre-Show countdown, which I normally despise, would've been welcome, if just for some light. Well, that's why God made cell phones.

Upon finally sitting, there were two soda pop cans in the two cup holders - way to go, clean-up crew. I literally saw 7 people leave the theatre when that showing ended. Cleaning up should've been quick so you can continue your discussion about who's ID you'd use to go out that night.

But I digress, the soda pop cans were obviously not sold by the world's slowest concession employees. I just moved them over and the lights finally came on a bit roughly 7 minutes before the show. Typically, I hate when people have their cell phones lit up in the theatre, as they always want to hold them up high so the entire rest of the theatre gets the pleasure of the bright light while they babble on their ancient MySpace account. But, in this case, it's understandable as no one could see anything.

Question, and I've always wanted to ask this, are the employees at the concession stand told to go as slow...as...possible? Fine, I know they're not - I'm a former AMC employee and I wasn't. Although, the pennies they generously give in the paychecks might not put the right fire under them. But seriously, it's already an insult that we have to pay about $13 just for one popcorn and one soda, but they add the salt, on the wound, that is, by making us wait 20 minutes in a line of 3 people.

By God, I wish someone would open a concession stand with somewhat good deals - yeah, I know that's how they get their money, blah, blah, and I wish someone would open at least an express lane. ""Two Items or Less Lane! No Children!"" Heaven.

I'm not disappointed easily, but I've given this place three chances to impress and they've consistently disappointed.   I live nearby and was very excited for a new, trendy place to eat & drink. The first time we went there, we sat at the ""outside"" bar. The male bartender was not personable at all-he was actually quite rude. When I politely asked him if he knew the price of a liquor off the top of his head (and not to worry about it if he didn't, I was just curious), he snottily replied with, ""well, there's not a button for it so I don't know."" He then rolled his eyes and walked away. I was astounded at how rude he was but shrugged it off. I actually felt bad because I thought somehow I offended or embarrassed him because he didn't know the price of this particular liquor, so I apologized to him, and he proceeded to made another smart comment about how he charged me the well price but that the next time I come in it might be much higher, again being very snotty and rude. My boyfriend was actually pretty upset at the way he spoke to me but chose to let it go because we just aren't the type if people to be confrontational or to complain.  After our meal and about an hour before close, he told us he was leaving and that another girl would be taking care of us. When she showed up all she did was clean the bar in preparation to close (even though that wasn't for another hour) and didn't even introduce herself or say hello. I waited for her to notice that my boyfriend's Blue Moon was empty but she was too busy cleaning so I asked her myself. She asked me what beer he was drinking, I told her, then watched her pour the wrong beer and give it to me as if I wouldn't notice. (Not all alcohol is available at that side of the bar. For instance Blue Moon and the liquor I was drinking are stored at the main bar, another point of annoyance for the original, rude male bartender. But how is that my fault? I didn't know that.  And clearly this girl didn't feel like going to the other bar to pour the correct beer for my boyfriend, even though she specifically asked me which beer he was drinking and then lazily poured whatever wheat beer they had in tap at the bar we were sitting at.)

The lady was on her phone the whole time talking personal business while my mother and I stood they're waiting for her to get off or put the person on hold. All we wanted to do was to ask her to get that dog cookie for us. So after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave and while walking out the door the lady shouted thanks for coming. That pissed me off cause she put down the phone to say bye but not to get an actual freaking sale. I'll continue going to to petsmart.

bacon butter burger, lettuce style - SO DISAPPOINTED. I had high expectations for a burger cooked in butter. While not terrible, this is not even comparable with in-n-out.

chicken fingers - Decent, although I've been spoiled by Shane's BBQ tenders which are made in house. I'm assuming Culver's came frozen in a big bag and then were deep fried. Still, pretty good for fast food.

green beans - Not cooked nearly enough for my liking, forced down several fork-fulls then threw the rest away.

It is 4 stories high, shaped like a football and stadium, with huge billboards facing into the 2 water fountains, its only redeeming value.

It is populated with typical Scottsdale type restaurants....Big on decor, small on taste, with chain restaurants peddling Chef/Designer highly stacked fusion flavors masking average casual food for a larger tab per serving. 

Even the hords of young, large bossomed hostesses, bartenders and waitresses in black t-shirts are the attractions that were first ubiquitous in Scottsdale, then downtown Phoenix around the Diamondback Stadium, has now moved to the west side of the Valley! Margarittaville, Johnny Rockets, Fox Sports Grill, Kabuki Japanese...all formula chains for the average masses who think they are getting something special, but aren't. 

Meanwhile, the Superbowl early this year, the reason why this complex was completed (and for the new football Stadium) has come and gone, the housing boom has collapsed, and the westside house prices have dropped 30 - 40%. Consequently, within a couple of blocks, the luxury condos are being auctioned off, the Westgate Offices atop the stores are empty, and so are the new office buildings. 
The anchor Hotel the Renassaince, also a Westin of Kierland  poser, is nicely lit but largely empty. There is a conference center attached, so it might get some occupancy other than Football season weekends, but the Homewood Suites nearby has got to be a summer bargain hotel.

This is classic Valley gaudiness at its worst. And it is set conveniently off the Loop 101 at Glendale Road near the Agua Fria riverbed, but otherwise it is a vast open field of former farm land.

I picked this place because of the reviews that I've read here.  I feel compelled to give my 2 cents worth.

We started out with jalapeno hushpuppies along with their remoulade.  The pups were very tasty (good start).

For our main course, we ordered the fried green tomato salad to share, my wife ordered the gumbo with a side of fried okra, and I ordered the fried catfish with double okra on the side.

The lag time between our pups and meal was LONG......outrageously long.  When they finally brought our meal, my wife didn't get her okra.  They explained that it would take a few more minutes.  Keep in mind, my plate had okra so I guess they must have forgot about hers.  It was no less than 10 minutes before they brought hers out.  

When we finally received our meal the bartender apologized for the wait and explained that everything they have is fresh breaded and not frozen which is why it takes longer.  I can understand how fresh breaded takes longer but you should find a way to do it faster or take it off the menu if it's going to logjam your kitchen.

All this being said, even after the wait, if the food was good I would be writing a positive review right now.  The problem is, the food was just so so.  The okra had NO flavor and was not fully cooked to a nice crisp crust.  My catfish flavor was ok but the breading was pretty thick.

From a flavor perspective, I have never found such an interesting Asian/fusion style of food in a quick-serve setting. The food is remarkably rich and spicy, it's really refreshing to see a mass-market place be so bold. Being so deeply impressed initially, I really, really wanted to like this place. I have since given it about three or four tries. Yeah, not so much.

First of all, I'm not sure whether it's the quality of the meat, the parsimonious manner in which it's cut or some combination of the two, but their meat is always tough and stringy. When its breaded, the breading is inevitably chewy and hard because the meat inside the breading is so insubstantial that all the moisture gets sucked out in the frying process. Not even the chicken comes in substantial enough chunks to be juicy. 

The amusing thing is, what made me like this place at the outset was the delicious sauces. You're enjoying the sauces so much you can easily overlook how crappy the meat is. Alas, that will only take them so far, as time and time again you are reminded of the crappy meat as you are compelled to floss vigorously.

Portions are another issue. They're too small for the price. Instead of takeout containers overstuffed with rice and entrees, grandma-sized portions are stingily arranged on a small plastic plate. I never have a problem finishing my entire meal and I always wish there was more. 

I think Pick Up Stix has a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand, they want to be Pei Wei, all flashy stainless steel and fancy real estate. On the other hand, come on folks, it's takeout faux-Chinese (""pick"" ""up"" - see what they did there?). The best takeout faux-Chinese is always known for generous portions at low prices. At Pick Up Stix, you unfortunately get neither.

The patronage reflects my opinion about the place each time I go: it's always nearly empty. I really don't expect it to last. That's a shame, I really will miss the unique flavor profiles.",review,A_VCj_m1zqW0gc0zSzQ3tA,0,1,0

they also have regular beers and liquor, and even a menu - which i never realized til someone sitting next to me was presented  a hamburger at their table. 

overall it's not my style, gimmicky, co-edy and obnoxious, and i only end up here when someone else wants to go here for some reason that i can never fathom.",review,7GC9fVWKa4a1ZmBGLH6Uww,1,2,1

They market themselves as a sandwich shop but I just don't buy it.  More so, it was a hipster hangout where it seems people go to look cool.  Granted, the few items the did have were quite good, but I just expected a nice turkey sandwich, but that wasn't happening.  

The service was on the verge of incompetent but the owner did swing by with a loaf of bread.  Too bad we had to ask for oil at the counter to dip it in (our waitress was absent).  

Their water was unpalatable and they didn't have a lemon, lime, orange or anything wedge to make it slightly less offensive.  My friends that live in Phoenix told me though, this is just the way it is there.

Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate. 

Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us. 

I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro. 

They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.

Update 11/8/2010
Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.  

We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.

Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.

We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.

0 stars for the service, or lack there of.  My business partner and I were in town for a convention.  We heard we should check out Lola.  So we did.  We were excited.  The lady (I use the term loosely here) who took our order was LESS than patient OR helpful.  We asked a few questions.  She barely answered us, then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed.  An example.  We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water.  She mumbled something about the bar/table.  My partner walked over and saw no cups.  She came back and asked where the cups were.  On the table came an exasperated retort.  I walked over to inspect for myself.  There were no cups on the table.  So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table, if so there appeared to be none.  She said they are on the table, but *sigh* I'll go check, but I know they're there!  10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups.  IMAGINE THAT the customer was right.  I watched this lady serve other customers.  It appears that regulars are treated with a smile and courtesy and patience.

I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer, the person looked right at me and said oh we don't carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susan's line is a Michaels only item.  I gave the woman the line name and said no we don't carry that I'm sure.  I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer, Oh that must be brand new.  I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we can't do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen.   Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right.  so I go up to pay, a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michael's card?  I say sure do and hand it to her.  Oh that's not a Michaels card ours are red.  I explain that it's a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist I'm there quite a bit.  She says I've never heard of that before.  Well it's a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there.  she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work.  She scans it and then says oh it says you have a $5  off coupon loaded on this card.  My response;  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend.  Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words I'm not sure,  let me call the manager.  So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items.  They finally agree to try it and I'm finally out the door just 40 minutes later.  And that's not even the bad part!

Unlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken. 

As we were looking at the ""lunch special"" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom ""are you Chinese?"" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in ""what does that mean?"" The lady proceeded by pointing at the ""seafood pancake"" section on the menu and saying ""I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot."" Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said.. or else... 

So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini ""kimchi"" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce. 

By the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn't take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat. 

In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said ""you can't take that home"". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said ""you are not allowed to take the kimchi home"". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? ""Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?"" She hesitantly gave me a lid.

""Hey, hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'""... only if I said that to her face...

Oh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.

There is no indication when you walk in that it's a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something. 

We sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived?

Finally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order. 

Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio.

I ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked. 

The pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza. 

I should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill. 

The final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in.

Gee, good thing me and my husband weren't really hungry, twenty bucks for a snack? Not bad quality but tiny quantity for price.

Pretty Nail tale with Tiffany-
My 10 year old first mani/pedi
4:35 water and feet in chair only 13 minutes and painting toes. Prepped and painted fingernails from the chair- in 20 minutes. 35 minutes in all. Told owner I was unhappy and she said that a kid mani/pedii was 35 minutes then later 35 to 45 minutes. Tiffany never let it dry between coats so when she sat her under the light she told her only 5 more minutes and I stopped her. She said only the under coats will be wet and the top will be dry. I told her Really because you never even let it dry between coats.  She said not 4 coat. Base 2 color and top is 4 ... well top and base dry fast she said...Owner said"" fast or slow it doesn't matter as long as the polish looks good and it looks good."" I didn't tip her on purpose...not because I'm poor- I got poor service. I would expect this for a color change but not a spa pedicure/manicure.  Very disappointed.

The Holiday Express I stayed at is better than this. Priceline tricked me when I requested for a 4 star and indicated that this was a 4 star in name your own price.

Cons:
1) They have cactus in the parking lot where when I got home late, it was dark, poorly lit lot, and opened my car door, step out of the car, and step on to cactus severely injuring my foot to where I can not walk anymore. Who puts low cactus in a dimly lit parking lot where when you get out of a car, someone can step on it? Being injured on vacation is no fun and very painful!
2) hotel room and property is old, like from the 1980s though the front desk boy told me that the rooms were newly renovated
3) Given the previous reviews I asked for a quiet room, but was given a room where the squeeking and thumping and wall shaking, woke me up at 5 in the morning. The neighbors flushing the toilet, showering, and running water can all be heard.
4) the bathroom door is so jammed that it requires both hands, all of my body wait and a few minutes of wrestling with it to open/close it
5) Requested a single bed, however upon arrival, was told that it would be 30/extra a night for a single bed instead of 2 doubles
6) 80s style tube TV 
7) pink 80s decor
8) worn down bed with body dent in it
9) wifi costs 9.99/for 24 hours even though its signal is only 1 bar

My salad wasn't a salad it was a paper plate of mixed greens - really no tomatoes, nothing on it or in it other than lettuce and she threw a packet of Newmans Dressing on the table just like the ones you get at Burger King or McDonald's. My steak - it was OK - I asked for medium and got medium well and that was the best part of it. The steak is served on a paper plate and when I asked about utensils I was directed to go get my own from around the corner - yup plastic ware for a steak on a paper plate.

I'm a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer.  After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar.

During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try.  Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that we're not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt.  The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar.  Let me remind you that's is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant.  The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel.

I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here.  During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this.

I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting.

The bar tenders were awesome.  One night I was carrying around a largeish trophy (Why because I own one).  I put it on the bar to order beer and they asked me if I wanted a glass or if I wanted them to put it in the trophy.  Yes, yes I did (although they did have to pour the drink into the glass first cause the trophy was to big to properly fit under the tap).  This might not be a big deal to some, but since I've been kicked out of bars for drinking out of said trophy before and that was the first time I've ever had a bar tender be so cool about it.  Every time I've been hear the bar staff has rocked even when they are extremely busy.

Food.  I think I've eaten here once, so I'm not going to comment on it.  However I have been here when they switch from neighborhood bar mode to dance bar mode.  If you are at a table still eating at that time they have no hesitation moving your table out of the way, if you're lucky they will tell you about it before hand.

It's a good place for watching football/UFC/etc.  Could maybe use some more TV's.  Music is nothing outstanding, it's your typical dance/top 40's/etc that you would expect at any college dance bar.  Since the crowd often is college/recent grads, it fits the bar nicely.

I don't normally include bouncers in my reviews, but after what I saw the last time I was there, it's affected my opinion of the place and is the reason the place is only getting 2 stars.  If you are kicking someone out and the are leaving peacefully, there is no reason to put your hands on him, other than maybe to keep him from falling over the place.  So when I see a bouncer aggressively pushing a guy who has thrown up his hands in surrender, and in the process the bouncer knocks over a girl who has done nothing wrong, that's just not cool.  Maybe it's just me but I would think someone who works for the bar should be picking her up off the ground instead of nearly trampling her to help the bouncer who put her there while throwing out someone who is giving them no resistence on his way out.",review,AM2X1tso9b62GhMobfTHAw,0,1,1

This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.

When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.

Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying ""excuse me"" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.

I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.

After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.

Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.

We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.

Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout. 

When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us. 

When our server said she could take the fries back ""to keep them warm until our trout was ready"", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.

Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day. The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.

As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable.

We had eaten lunch there a couple of years ago on the patio, and I had a great time then.  However, the temp was 114 on this particular afternoon, so the patio wasn't an option.  We were the only people in there other than the dude who talked on his phone the ENTIRE time we were there.  He even managed to order and eat his entire lunch while yapping.  

I ordered fish tacos, as I had the last time we were there.  Something has changed.  A previous reviewer mentioned this, and he was on the money.  I received two constructed tacos . . .soft tortilla shells in the shaper with cabbage etc.  only no fish!  Two large-ish filets of fish were on the side!  It was really messy . . .I had to tear apart the filets with my fork, smash some fish into the full-of-cabbage tortillas, and complete my own taco :(  I gave up on the second one and ate the veggie taco and the fish separately.  I really didn't like the seasoning on the fish, either.  I thought it was too harsh and blackened.  Ultimately, the fish tacos were ""meh"" to say the most.  I will not order them again.  My bf ordered a sandwich and since he must follow a special diet, he cannot eat mayo.  He reads ingredients very closely and requests things he can't have be left off.  His sandwich came slathered in mayo, even though it wasn't mentioned on the menu as an ingredient.  When we looked around for our server, he was nowhere to be found.  So, while I munched on messy tacos, bf sat looking sad for the next 5-7 minutes until we finally saw the server and flagged him down.

That being said, the server was AWESOME about making the new sandwich sans mayo, and we even received an extra order of sweet potato fries with sea salt.  They were yummy!  And when you see their house ""chipotle ketchup,"" DO try it!  I looked for it in the Biltmore gift shop, but they didn't have any for sale.  Oh well.

I was disappointed. And my friend I was with who had been one of Stickler's die-hard fans said that, although it was okay this time, the place seems to have gone down hill.

Stickler's wasn't busy at all, maybe 4 tables of customers and 3 people in line, but although there were alot of workers behind the counter, the service was very slow. We had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches. Now my friend has been there when it was jam-packed and she said the service then was much quicker. We went about 2 so maybe the staff was worn out from the lunch rush earlier.

The bread was good, crunchy on the outside and soft inside but the vegetarian sandwich itself was boring. It's supposed to have Swiss, Provolone and American cheese on it. I couldn't even taste the Swiss or Provolone at all, the American over powered the sandwich and was more like a cheez-whiz type.

I'm always on the look out for a good malt, one that really tastes like a malt and not a shake. My chocolate malt tasted more like a shake and I wasn't impressed with the ice cream. My buddy liked her vanilla malt though.

The one thing I did like about Stickler's is that they have the small bags of Miss Vickie's chips to buy.

I asked to talk to Brenda, the office manager and was brushed off twice. Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours! I guess she didn't have the balls to face me at that point. What could she have said really? 

The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in. When I pointed that out, she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart. Instead of apologizing, she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake. 

When the NP did come see me, she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about. I was quite appalled. I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart.

I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.

The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.

""You can't do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).

Our waiter was really nice at first, but seemed flustered and as if he wasn't getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables.  I waited tables for 12 years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up, a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork.  Of the two hostesses, ONE of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water, tea and soda for us, but alas they did nothing.  We waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar, so he poured himself a glass, which he was scolded for!  I could not believe it, I was shocked.  A guest should NEVER be treated this way.  If anything, someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal. 

The chips were good, and they kept them coming, so props to them for that.  They are served with bean dip and salsa.  I liked the salsa a lot, not spicy enough for me, but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff, including cilantro which I find many ""salsas"" don't even contain!  To me, it is not salsa without cilantro.  The teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking.  They should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size.  It's only about 2 Tablespoons, and that aint much salsa (beware, some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers - three or four bites and it's gone)!  Anyhow, we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took SO long to come out.  Our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually coming.....someday.

Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered.  Sadly, two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas (which came out of the kitchen very cool, not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat) had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas, so they couldn't even eat what was at the table, which was getting cold.  After the two missing meals came out, one was the wrong meat, red meat instead of chicken.  More waiting...the table eats, minus one.  When everyone is nearly finished, the right chicken taco dish comes out.  It was delicious, but overpriced.  The chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way I like them, with a little bit of onions, more cilantro, lettuce, lime and pico de gallo.  They also came with cheese, but I don't like cheese on tacos.  They came on tiny little corn tortillas, which themselves were good, but way too small to make decent tacos that didn't fall apart.  Plus, I ran out of  the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone.

Our waiter was really nice except for the scolding (I'm still floored by that), so I can't decide if he sucked or the place sucks, or maybe they both do...We definately won't be back.",review,g13P8XfDT5Zfcts4wai4-Q,0,0,0

So, walk in and would agree that the ambiance was less than. Dinner tables were cheap and the table cloth was tacky. Oh almost forgot why is there a large mirror on the wall? Were given dinner menus by a impolite waitress who I suspected was surely going to be the owner. The first thing that hit was the prices! $$$ I kindly asked the waitress if I could just have a Gyro sandwich. The answer was NO! (rudely). Those are only available during lunch time! Ok, so next option was to gamble on a gyro plate priced at $14.95. We placed our order and waited. The food arrived on a timely manner. The food was hot and looked good. The tzatziki-sauce was a 10! Although the gyro meat was not to my tasting, it was ok for being real hungry. Eventually the waitress started warming up to us! :) 

PROBABLY WONT RETURN AGAIN.

Pros- Fresh food, Location

Cons-Couldn't get what I really wanted.(A gyro sandwich)

-$$$ pricey! $36 for 2 adults and 2 children. (2 gryo plates and a coke.)

We were the only two people in the place and would have thought that the owner, to make a good impression and show gratitude for what business he did have might have come by the table to ask how the food is, make small talk or anything. He sat at their front counter watching a baseball game when we got there. The waitress took our order, he went back to cook it and resumed his place at the counter to watch the game. We felt like we were putting the guy out to have to pull away and actually cook for the only two customers he had. 

As far as the food is concerned: You can grill a great burger at home with decent meat and the fixin's you want to  put on it. In other words, it wasn't anything special and certainly nothing that I would go back for.

Half of the bad that we caught wasn't worthy of stage time, the other half was.  The horn players were exceptional, the Keyboardist wasn't.  I'll stick to the facility.  The Rhythm Room is a Phoenix, classic on the music scene, or so I'm told.  This was evident when Paul Reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage.  That was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place.  Beyond that, I'm can't really claim that this place is worth the time.  We'll have to try it again to confirm, yet my urge to do so isn't high right now.  The neighborhood is questionable.  The entrance is not obvious, the bar and the service are not inviting.  The music area of the building is excellent.  You sit very close to the band.  The one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setup/teardown between bands.  We waited for an hour between bands.  The Rhythm Room is missing an opportunity here, they need a comedian or something the fill the gap.  

Some fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements.  Just because it's a known classic doesn't mean that it can't change for the better.  The one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if they're getting good bands, then it makes for a great night.  The annoyances only become obvious when you have an hour to descern them between bands.

I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.

She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.

They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat, though.  Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.

I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).

Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!

I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!

So she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!  She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis.",review,6X4f6bB9XQ1H0qtz1eUaFg,0,1,0

I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience, I have to say, this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences. The service was so bad, we didn't even get to try the food! 

True Yelper that I am, I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner. I saw all the reviews about the ""bad service"" , but I paid more attention to the ""Cheap"" and  ""Delicious Pho"" reviews because after all, you can't knock it til you've tried it. Yes, the place looks as divey as any food dive gets, yes the place isn't as clean as it probably can be, but hey, all the best pho I've  had (Da Vang, Khai Hoan, Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.  I was excited. 

It was around 6pm and the place wasn't busy (there were 5 other customers besides us, and 3 of them were on their way out), so we went ahead and sat ourselves down. The server gave us menus, and made her way back behind the cash register. 

After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot), we were ready to order. I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her. I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her, and she turned back to her conversation. For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck. But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing, occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasn't about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food, but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I had enough. The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant. 

We are never going back to this restaurant, and I suggest you don't either. Just as it isn't acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it also isn't okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment. We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review. I don't care how delicious and cheap your food is, you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals. 

Thanks, but no thanks, Pho House. I don't need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food.

6. ""mechanical problems"".

8. kicked everybody off saying we weren't taking off on this plane.

9. made everybody wait in a long@$$ line that didn't move while we saw a ticketing agent to rebook our flight (while I held up a DELTA SUCKS sign made with pen and crayon on my sketchbook)

However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory. 


We were seated immediately. 

Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is). 

Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls. 

When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us.
I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand.

The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.

I'll keep this update short and sweet:

$3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.

Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad. 

Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD.

Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.

Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""I don't split checks"", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky.

I have never been to a Five Guys before, so this was something new. My first reaction upon opening the doors was the music was blaring. Too loud, at least. The music was classic rock, which I don't mind. After walking up and reviewing the easily understood menu and waiting in line for a few minutes, someone took our order. The order taker seemed like she was having a long day, not seeming very interested in the customer. While taking the order, one could clearly see the kitchen. It seemed kind of like In-N-Out, but everyone was moving much slower. It was as if everyone was moving in slow motion.

Much to my dismay, they did not offer Dr. Pepper, my favorite soft drink. I was surprised that they offered other lesser known drinks, but not Dr. Pepper? Come on. After waiting about 6 or 7 minutes, my food arrived in a bag. A bag? Really? I was planning on eating inside, not take out. Even McDonald's does better than that. Digging through the bag I first took out the fries, which were in a cup, and I took a bite. My first impression of the fries was they were nothing special, and too salty. I like salt on my fries as it adds flavor, but there was simply too much salt. As a result, in addition to the fact that the serving was quite large, I finished only about half of my fries.

Now onto the burger. I paid about $10 for my meal, so I was thinking to myself that this better be the best burger I have ever tasted in a long time. Unwrapping the product in its tin foil wrapping, I noticed that the presentation of the burger was sub par. The burger did not look appetizing, at all. Almost disgusting, as a matter of fact. The cheese was dripping over the bun, and I couldn't even see all the ingredients on the burger. Taking my first bite, it didn't taste bad. A pretty classic American burger taste, I must say. It did taste rather close to Wendy's. 

Upon finishing my meal, I was not impressed. My stomach felt greasy, and I felt the need to go hike a mountain a couple times, which I did, as Tempe Butte is close by. I felt my stomach almost on the point of rejecting it, it was that greasy. Seriously. Overall, Five Guys is way to expensive, unbelievably greasy, and makes your stomach cringe. The atmosphere is nice though, thus the two stars. 

If you had to choose between Five Guys and In-N-Out, INO is the clear winner in every category.",review,Ab6te7czFqcMEJemHcyxsg,0,0,0

The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad. 

Carrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed. 

I've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since. 

As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional ""daily soup"" is appreciated. 

The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear.

The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own.

Today I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it.

Dilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared.

Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return.",review,K_gNqlirV0kppqCGnfGiOQ,0,1,0

While I understand the appeal of this centralized pizza joint -- a slice is 1/4 the pizza itself. The crust is a couple inches high and the pizza itself is barely 1/4 inch. I had cheese and while cheese pizza isn't remarkable as is, the slice I had here was considerably unimpressive.

We paid $9.31 for 2 slices and a 20 oz beverage. 

What also put me off to this place was the cold staff and multiple things did not seem to be working right while there -- including their ice machine and their sound system (cut on and off).

If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say. 

0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.  

0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it.

In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.  

The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.

On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.  

There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!

When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of ""I am the only staffperson here...""  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception. 

6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again.

Staffperson's attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.  

6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.  

6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.  

6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated ""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish"".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.

6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have ""The Best Curry in the Valley"",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.

Good news...More restaurants opening in Downtown, more options especially late night options...

Bad news...More restaurants opening in Downtown wanting to make a quick buck but does not deliver on food and quality...

I came here with a couple of friends really excited to try the only sushi restaurant in DT open for dinner.  There has been some good review on the place and I wanted to give it a chance...I should have gone north to Hana or Yasu!
Walking in, I noticed the decor was another warehouse looking restaurant trying to be modern...only thing is , its not.  From the neon lights under bar to the wood paneling to the tin like tables, chairs, and barstools...its been done 30 times over.  I wish it had more character, a little bit more distinctive.  We are in the art district.  I don't want to walk in a restaurant that looks similar to ones that are already open in the same area?  Okay enough with that, the artist in me is rambling again..sorry..back to the ""food"" review.

Food:  The menu to me was a little confusing.  For being a Sushi joint, it had so many other things also, mostly stirfry items.  I decided to stick to what I came here to try, sushi.  I ordered squid salad to start.  I should not have ordered that to start.  The salad was so salty and it was drowning in dressing...bad start...I then ordered some sashimi including saba, sweet shrimp, and of course my favorite toro.  I was a little disappointed that they did not have uni..how can you not have uni! 
Saba...not bad...
Sweet Shrimp....foul tasting
Toro.....couldn't even bite through it
A good sushi joint has to have fresh fish...good sushi needs to be executed by a sushi chef with good knife skills...simple as that..
When your fish is not that fresh and your sushi chef fish slicing techniques are not there, you have a losing combo.

My friend out of frustration had the head chef make us something...He brought out the geisha roll.
Spicy tuna is not my thing but out of courtesy, we did ask him to pick, I tried it..it was ok, again I am not too keen on chopped up tuna, which in this case tasted like it was food processed.  A little too mushy..

Drinks:
Beers: Been done.  Infused vodkas: Been done Cocktails: Been done.

Good Points:  Nice staff, cool Teapots, and clean restrooms

All in all, I guess I was hoping for a sushi joint that was more innovative and creative with equally good skills to execute.  Maybe I am too harsh.  Or maybe I am just saying it how it is...As I left the joint, I felt like I have been to a sushi restaurant like that so many times before...

Hopefully they will succeed with less critical customers unlike myself..best of luck!!",review,xs_fnNe0hofd7ZOupCjesQ,3,10,2

I've heard good things about this place from my sister's friends (notice, I didn't say ""my"" friends) and I've always been curious.  Errand days are kinda ho-hum anyway, so I was excited to finally check this place out.  The reason I order a doughnut that is stripped off glaze and topping is that I'd  like to taste the actual product. 

Two doughnuts for my little guy and me for $1.60.  As the girl handed me the paper bag I was extra careful handling it for nothing.  Cold doughnuts?  Am I just so used to piping hot beignets?    Right off the first bite, I could feel the cheap hydrogenated oils coating the roof of my mouth.  Then the second bite, the feeling is now in my throat.  Eeek!  I asked my son what he thought.  ""It's okay,""  he stared at the doughnut and looked up at me.  I grab his doughnut and along with mine threw both in the paper bag it came with and chucked it.   Honestly, it would have been better to fry these sinful things in lard.  There is something about chemically laden food that I despise most!

Would I give it a second chance?  Not until they change their frying oil!

So we ordered the sushi sampler for me and the Korean beef and a veggie roll for her. I got the sushi, but not the salad and soup that it comes with. The veggie roll turned into an egg roll.

Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.

 I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of.

While the teachers were very knowledgeable in their trade, the program and administration is less than desirable. When I first toured the school and started classes in January, I was promised many things to learn, one of them being makeup classes. Still to this day they do not have those classes available at the school, and those were pretty big reasons to why I wanted to go there.
There was also a lot of drama in the midst of my schooling there. Several administrators left, a teacher left, and they changed everything that we were used to. They started focusing on advertising instead of getting students product to use, and there was a lot of times when school product would go missing when they didn't go missing before the administration change.
besides those things, the school is okay. At the very least, it will teach you what  you need to know to be an aesthetician in the state.

We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.

We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.

The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.

While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.

We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. 

About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)

I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened.

When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular ""Chinese"" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.

Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.

Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.

Our ""Har Gow""/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.

The trademark ""beef internal organs"" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon. 

The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.

I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too. 

I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell.",review,e9HWnHUYlt9758oileaISw,0,2,1

If you feel like Kubrick's Lolita really speaks to you, as in it mirrors your life, then you've found a place to feel comfortable in your pervert skin.

If you're of age to consume alcohol, they've got a bar here. The thing about this bar though is that they're really sloppy about pouring drinks, ie. a Manhattan should not taste like a barber's cleaning solution. The decor and set up of this place really needs a face lift.

A few pluses though... If you're under 21, I could see how this would be appealing.

Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______.

1. Loved Chef Wade Moises when he was at SASSI in Scottsdale. I'm a fan for god's sake.

2. I'm a big pasta-crazed fool. Seriously love it.  

3. Love dwntwn Phx.

So what could go wrong? 

Service: 
No one to greet you properly at the door. The space is awkward enough as it is.  Staff was always inattentive and often seen hanging out at the bar. When asked why cocktails the ""signature cocktails"" took so long to prepare, the server responds clumsily ""Because I had to read and learn how to make them just now."" Yikes.

Back to the greeting... We waited about 2 minutes in the doorway listening to staff sitting at the bar chat about how they hoped they could close early that night. It was only 4:30 pm.

Vibe:
The space feels cold and almost clinical. With the lack of fabric in the space, it feels like I'm the ER of a hospital (minus the curtains that surround each patient bed.) The staff certainly doesn't add warmth. Also reminds me of a corporate staff break room. Art on the walls is just bizarre (read other's comments.)

The Cocktails:
They look good on paper. See my comment above about Service. That's all I can really say. 

The Food:
Each time, the Fritto Misto app ($9) was salty and sad to look at. Orecchiette with Sausage ($15) looks fantastic on paper, but never quite right. 

In fact, I've tried every pasta dish on the menu. I'm simply heartbroken. I crave handmade fresh pasta, but the pasta here just leaves me guessing... I'm I the odd ball out? Why do all these Yelpers love the pasta? It's wimpy and the proteins almost taste boiled (texture and flavor.) Approx quote from a guest, ""gummy handmade pasta that looks like bloated playdoh in water."" The sauces seem near amateur as if they were never tasted before serving. Usually on the salty side.

Forget about portions, price, space, ambiance, whatever. The important question... DOES IT TASTE GOOD? 

Sadly, no.

At each visit, I brought other notable chefs from the Valley. In one instance, the five of us ordered an entire dinner, ate a few bites of each dish, asked for the bill and decided to head next door to Sens for dinner (which is another review in the making.)

I'll wait till sometime in the fall season before heading back to Pasta Bar. Maybe it needs more time (although it's been open for a few months already.) 

As always, I'd encourage you to try it out and make your own decision. Wade is a talented chef who can do amazing things in the kitchen. I have faith in you my friend!

Side note... for those of you who fixate on butter and bread service at restaurants, do us all a favor and stick to your cheap filler salad bars. Bread and butter service is simply never worth commenting on as a crucial component of a meal unless it's stellar.  (BTW... I realize the irony of making commentary on the worthless comments)",review,HaDEZSNSTNFmq6laVB6ZMQ,6,12,3

The service is slooooow, food is canned and poor quality, drinks are weak and expensive.  The only upshot was all of the Jimmy Buffett paraphernalia and music, and I've already got a lot of that stuff.

The next time I'm itching to get my island groove on, I'll do it right.  We'll grill chicken and burgers in the back yard, put the booze in the blender, light the Tiki torches, invite 20 or 30 people over and jam to Jimmy.

My daughter ordered the burger, it came with fries AND salad for under 7.00. The burger was very well done, but it was 1/2 lb of ground beef. The fixings were on the side and it arrived on an unremarkable hamburger bun. The fries were crisp and the salad was fine but it was DRENCHED in a watered down thousand island dressing.
My eggs benedict was fine. Nothing to make me want to order it again, but not bad either. I would try their pancakes next time. They looked pretty good!
My husband's french toast stack arrived. 3 pieces of french toast with ham,egg and swiss cheese between the layers. Kinda like a Monte Cristo sandwich. They bring out warm maple and berry syrup. My husband liked it. But, said he would try something else next time.
I ordered my hashbrowns extra crispy, my husband ordered his ""burnt"", his order came out exactly how i wanted mine. Crispy dark golden and cooked well. Bummer I had to just eat the top of mine.

The decor:

First of all, this place is PAINFULLY tiny. I've only been here once, and while it was half full, so it wasn't completely unbearable. But I can't imagine what it must be like when they have guest DJs and other performers in. A tiny place that's packed isn't popular. It's just... small.

The walls are covered in white (leather?), the tiles are white, everything is white - I get it, white like Cream? I appreciate the commitment to the color but the theme is waaay off. The hard surfaces make the place look cold and very hospital like - I would have liked to see more smooth lines and softness in the design, more flowy like cream.

The atmosphere:

The dig the loud music and the techno. I get so sick of hearing the same stupid songs on the radio. I love the change in scene. Phoenix/Scottsdale is so stale in terms of music. This is a nice change. But it's too loud when you can't even put an order in for your drink. I literally had to pull myself onto the bar (I'm tiny, 5'3"") so I could give my order directly into the bartender's ear.

They also had a really cool entertainment act - a girl hung from a hoop suspended from the ceiling wearing a white bikini. She was clearly talented in her hoop manipulating and was mesmerizing to watch, but like I said, this place is TINY, and there were several instances in which she was inches away from kicking people in the face. And THAT would have been worth the ridiculous cover I didn't pay (I try to find any way not to.)

The drinks: 

Overpriced and terrible. Maybe the bartender THOUGHT she heard me say I wanted a glass of vodka piss, because that's what it tasted like.

In the last 12 months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE.

Yesterday (the Friday before my ""correctly"" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last week's debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that she'd call with any issues. Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident.

Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today. Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part? They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.

My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy.

We arrived, found we had free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you. A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus. Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? FAIL.

On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud, conversation intruding, music. We were reseated by the fireplace, and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. Bam. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous ""drive-by"" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of: 

""I don't know why it's taking so long...""
and
""I put the ticket in right after I took your order...""

So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?

FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.

On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?

Arrived early afternoon, ironically maybe that was the problem - there wasn't enough going on, place was dead. I would have hoped that a restaurant manager would realize that the few customers they may have at a slow time are just as important as those on a Friday night rush - standards are standards, you either have them or you don't.

Waitress was pleasant but not attentive - with a total of 3 occupied tables had to get up and get her attention for more chips. Chips though were very good; needed hotter salsa.

My friend had the steak fajitas; tasted OK but just luke warm. Fajitas are supposed to be sizzling hot; duh.

I had a so-so tamale and chicken enchilada. Enchilada was just warm, mostly a flat layer of cheese. Tamale filling was tasty shredded meat (as it should be) but corn meal was barely warm and almost tasted only partially cooked. Refried beans weren't warm enough to even melt the grated cheese sprinkled on top, which consequently then pulled off in a single congealed mass when I took a bite. 

Finally, the Cadillac margaritas were just average at best. 

$50 plus tip for two meals plus two margaritas; not worth it.

They occupy a buliding once occupied by Fate and Nine|05, the former of which was one of my favorite restaurants.

Entering the restaurant, we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water, which isn't exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment. Being the only ones seated in the small space, we were able to really examine it, and I noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up; it feels like a cafeteria. The installation of florescent lights, heat lamps, and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school. Whatever, we can deal with it. An overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food... fried everything, cheese crisps, foot long hot dogs, slider burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, etc. Apparently ""comfort food"" means deap fried grease? NO THANKS. I ordered the Braised Beef Tacos, which had the consistency of paste, but were average in taste. 

My biggest gripe with this place is the microwave (not even a turbo chef) sitting front and center in the kitchen. Look, I understand that some restaurants use microwaves (usually not good ones) in their kitchen, especially if it's a cold kitchen (which this isn't) but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious. I truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing. It made me completely lose my appetite when I saw them heating my girlfriend's rice for her chicken skewers in the microwave. yuck. She did mention she was neutral about her food. We are people who go out at least once a day for a meal and try a new place every time, so we know food. 

Everyone we encountered was nice, and the service was very friendly. Everyone seemed interested in how well we enjoyed our meal, the space, and they seemed interested in welcoming us back. Unfortunately, the place looks kind of makeshift on the ReBar side, and like a cafeteria on the Bliss side. I'm not really sure why it looks makeshift, perhaps it is just because it looks like a temporary wall in the back of the room, or because it looks so bare, but it looks like they are in there just for the time being. 

I feel compelled to go here again but only for drinks out on the patio. The inside looks like Mexico, the food wasn't very good, and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining.

The service.  Ah, the service.  First, let me spare the hard workers in my tirade.  The cooks, and those who actually are putting together food and cleaning, do a fabulous job.  The servers - or register-runners, have been incredibly disappointing.  They invoke this kind of back-story imagery:

""Mom!  My gas card didn't work, I almost didn't make it to Dana's party, I mean, can you imagine if I would have run out of gas, and had to talk to a commoner??  Wtf, Mom!""

""Shannon, your father and I decided that you need to pick up a part-time job, we will still pay for your BMW, your insurance, your condo, your cable, your birth control, your health insurance and your part-time college education, but we think it's time you worked about 8 hours a week.""

""OMG!  This is soooo ridiculous and unfair, Mom, wtf!""

And that is how Shannon (name made up) came to work at The Counter.  And that is why she sucks at service.  And that is why she doesn't appreciate how hard the rest of us work to purchase an $8- sandwich, and how a simple smile, some humor, and a ""thanks for coming in"", or ""how is everything tasting today"", could make such an enormous difference in someone's dining (albeit counter style) experience.  

Instead, after ordering the Chopped Salad and the Pea Soup from ""Shannon"", the cook brought me my soup, and I enjoyed it.  And I waited.  And waited.  There was no ticket, there was no chopped salad in the works.  (The prep area is fully visable.)  I graciously asked the cook if there was an order in for a chopped salad, and she said, ""oh no, I'm so sorry, let me make one on the fly for you!"".  She did, I ate, it was delicious, and I thanked her.  ""Shannon"" then presented me with my bill a full few minutes after I sat in front of an empty plate, I paid, and as she handed me my change she said, ""bye.""  I don't think I need to elaborate on that.  

So - to the Shannon's of the world - hurry up and get a rich boyfriend and become a trophy wife so the rest of us don't have to deal with your shitty service, bad attitude and hateful unsmiling demeanor.  And to the awesome cooks and service folks out there who manage at least a smile, bless you.  Bless you, every one.",review,J1_dnSaVYi17BoxK00y9AQ,3,2,5

I have to say i am disappointed with My Sister's Closet. I had heard such great things, so I was really excited to go. They did have some amazing designer purses, including a $3400 jimmy chu purse that was huge and gorgeous for $1899.  

The designer section clothing was hung on nice wooden hangers with their logo (Nice touch). 

However....... The items I saw around the store, and my friend with me agreed, seemed like more than 40% really were more appropriate for a thrift store, and a lot of the items were really dirty (and still had high prices). You could see food stains on a dooney bag.. a coach wristlet, black, had white food smeared all over it... still highly priced for as dirty as it is. The thing is... even if it is a brand.. sometimes your store reputation is worth more than the 10 bucks you'll make by selling something dirty. Just my .02. 

I saw sensors put though jeans pockets, wallets (in the leather!) and other questionable placements. When I asked about it.. the sales person just said, well maybe there is someone new who does not put it in the right place. That damages items people are buying, and they may not realize the big holes placed by those sensors. 

I loved there ""on the web"" tags. I've never seen that before, but they are really pretty and catch your eye if you want to take a closer look. 

I prefer consignment stores to identify the sizes on the hanger by color coding or some such to make it easier to find my sizes. I get bored really fast trying to find my size..  As a consumer, I would have spent more time looking had I been able to really scan the racks easier for size.

The shoes are nicely organized.... and clearly labeled. They were not over crowded so it was easy to see the shoes. 

There are some positives.. I purchased a le sportsac tiny bag for 9.99, it was new so i do feel it was a good deal.  but really be careful what you buy.. The prices for the purses seemed high for used resale and their obvious usage stains.",review,fgNjgqVP5dNgQFfQLyjXyQ,0,1,0

When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, ""not too long."" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. 

Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. 

After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out.

Seriously? You had to go pass it around to confirm that I'm not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell?

In the time since then, their attempts to improve the airport, transportation and parking, and terminals have made it extremely confusing. Get in the wrong lane and you'll end up in the parking garage, when all you wanted was to drop off someone at the Departures curb. 

Terminal 2 remains the most accessible, with a parking lot located across the street and few airlines stationed there. Because only a couple airlines now use this terminal, security is a breeze. However, it's the oldest terminal, smells bad (like rotten pizza) and doesn't appear clean. 

Terminal 3 a little more of a hassle, although they have a parking garage attached to the terminal allowing you to enter any level through the elevator. More airlines use this terminal and it's much smaller than Terminal 4, making it easier to navigate.

Oh, Terminal 4. You're so nice, new and clean. You have access to great restaurants like Flo's Shanghai Cafe, Einstein's, Quizno's and more. I love Taberna del Tequila for a drink just prior to my flight inside security access (I don't like to fly, I prefer a bloody mary prior to boarding). You have tons of shops from Borders Books to local AZ tourist junk. I would like to love you, but you are just a mess. It's way to difficult to navigate your lanes to get where you're going, pick up and drop off is dangerous due to the people who pull away from the curb into lanes without looking, and security is painful- not only is there always a LONG line, but TSA agents regularly yell at people to ""pay attention!""

It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.

You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.

It's OK, but beware. Unagi and other ""hot"" items have a ""beep-beep beep-beep"" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.

If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.

I decided to do a desert landscape out there instead, & called a number of landscape contractors I found here on Yelp & also at the Home & Garden Show at the fairgrounds.

I soon learned that this is an unprofessional industry overall.  I had several company representatives never return my call to set up an appointment to come over & do a survey.  I had others schedule an appointment & not show up.  I had others come & do the initial survey but never get back in touch with me with a price.  One guy I called said he would look at my yard on Google Earth & email me a survey.  (He never did, & I guess a $3500 job didn't make it worth his while to come over for a few minutes!)  I had a couple of others who got back in touch but with only a materials list.  I had asked for a sketch of what they would DO with my yard for all this money!  After probably more than a dozen tries, I finally had 3 legitimate, complete surveys in hand to decide between, & the price range only varied about $500.

One of my surveys was from Tom Baird at Creative Environments.  After the survey, he emailed me a materials list & a CAD drawing that gave me a good idea what my new yard would look like.  I liked it, so I went with them.  Next, though, my job got handed off to another company rep, David Inness.  David was likable, but the job ended up changing considerably from the agreement I had with Mr. Baird.  For instance, I was promised that a BobCat skip loader would be used to dredge down 4"" to remove the old grass before the new materials were applied.  That & other promises were not fulfilled.

On installation day, three workers (& no ""Foreman Chico"" whom I was promised would be here) came out to do the work.  They didn't remove the grass at all, but rather put down some black plastic material over about HALF (!) of the yard.  I complained, & one of the workers called Chico on his cell phone & handed it to me.  Chico explained to me that they weren't going to dig down, or put down any more plastic, unless I wanted to go to the hardware store & buy some more myself!  I tried to call David Inness, but he was unreachable.

The materials included a big pile of dirt & a big pile of gravel to be used for the job.  The workers hand shoveled the dirt to form the contoured mounds as planned, but then only applied a very thin coating of the gravel on top, leaving most of the big pile on the driveway, AND LEFT!  That was it, they told me, & that I could use the rest of the tons of gravel that I had bought in planters around the place, or if I wanted, they would have it picked up in a couple days!

After trying to call for a day or two, I finally reached David Inness, who got the workers to come back over & finish applying the gravel, which they did, but unevenly.  The gravel depth ended up being zero to 3"" deep.  I moved it around some myself to even it up, but I shouldn't have had to, & since I didn't get the dig-down preparation, the gravel was already skating out onto the surrounding driveway & sidewalk.  David had the workers now dig down a little around the edges, so that the top of the gravel would be down about an inch to stay put better.

This was the worst contractor experience I have ever had in my life.  The only thing saving it from a 1-Star rating is that the nice plan for the layout of the dirt & plants was followed, & the yard does look good now.  Of course I have a problem with grass coming up through the gravel, since it wasn't scooped out as promised.  (I attempted to kill it ahead of time with weed & grass killer as directed, but all my estimators told me you really need to do both.)

My only down note is on the service. If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant, you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees. As a result, you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.  Based upon my late lunch experience today, the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes). Regrettably, I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees. On a positive note, when you leave (regardless of the time you waited), the invisibility dust seems to be removed.

It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine. 

Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat! 

While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95). 

Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states ""no substitutions or modifications""... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a ""modification""? 

At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as ""Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body."" 

It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's ""beauty"" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of ""nothing fancy."" 

How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then? 

The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams ""pretentious and grandiose"" and tainted our entire experience.

I ordered two topping-heavy small pizzas from Naked Pizza.  I had a Groupon for $20 that only cost me $10.  So, keep in mind I am rating this on my entire experience that cost me merely $10 out of pocket.

The good?  The garlic topping is delicious.  The employees were friendly.  They were generous with their toppings.    

The bad? Daiya cheese is disgusting on this pizza and tasted like raw dough.  If you're off dairy, get the pizza sans cheese.  It will probably be a lot better!

The just okay?  The crust was okay-tasting, if not a little plain and dry.  The sauce was pretty good for one of us and just okay for the other.  

This is one of the two times in my life that I have ordered pizza and not kept the leftovers.  Of two adults and three kids eating the two small pizzas, we were left with one and a half 10"" pizzas, which we promptly tossed in the bin.  My daughter disliked this pizza so much, she picked off a few of her toppings and then told me she was full (when she said earlier how famished she was).

Obviously the restaurant can well benefit from the exposure without costing them too much. It's $20 voucher that I've paid $10 ahead. The restaurant only got $5 I believe. And I did Yelp! extensively before hitting the BUY button.

I understand that it's hard to find authentic foods in USA. Everything is Americanized for one reason or the other. Most Americans I know (not those that I don't know) can't handle strange taste, texture, weirdness, repulsion, and various dislikes. And I know that it's hard to get the same fresh or processed ingredients and spices from home countries.

Those are my pet peeves alright. And there is one more before I get onto the review. Comparison can be deadly.

I have tried Latin American foods (including Yucatan, Oaxaca, Belizean). So my knowledge is nil on Venezuelan foods. But I do have taste buds and experiences from various food cultures.

Overall. It sucked. I was referring to the taste, variety, and uniqueness. It didn't worth my dime. My friend and I had the Media Bandeja (1/2 the regular portion) for $25. The big plates came with 2 big serving of steamed white rice, 2 small cups of black beans sprinkled with cheese, half an ordinary avacado, 2 fried eggs (Chinese style, I cooked that all the time), 2 plain arepas (round flat breads), one chorizo sausage, one blood sausage, 2 scopes of shredded beef, one small steak, few green plantains, and few sweet plantains.

The blood sausage tasted like burned tired. I had blood pudding much tastier and smoother and more colorful that that. I grew up with blood pudding. Yummy!!! That maybe the reason that I'm vicious now. Heed my warning, it's not good for cholesterol.

The steak had tasty flavor; it's ordinary though. I believe it's 5 oz shrunk to 3 oz. The shredded beef reminds me of sloppy Joe. It's OK for the taste. The sweet plantains are regular fried plantains as found in some Chinese buffets or regular dessert menu. It's good for the sweetness but nothing more than that in this restaurant.

If you give me a steam bun or silver thread roll (both are steamed rice dough), I can tell how much salt it contains, the chewing satisfaction, the freshness, and the steamed distinct aroma. And I can eat it plain. Arepas? What's that? It's an tasteless, odorless, chewy carb that didn't excite my taste buds a bit. Boring!!! Honestly, I had no clue how special it was supposed to be. It tasted better after I stuffed avocado and shredded beef inside.

The green plantains were like hard cardboard. Fried carb without taste, but it has a green tinted color.

My friend also ordered Tequenos (fried breaded cheese sticks)... really tiny for $1 each. Chinese egg rolls ($1 each) are twice as big and they are greaser and tastier. (I ain't a size queen).

The Empanada Ham Queso was so tiny with 2-bite size for $4. Come on... are you kidding me!!! Calzones are more complicated and much bigger with ham and cheese and more ingredients, for similar price. (Again, I ain't a size queen).

My point is that it's so ordinary that I couldn't see the cost value especially for Bandeja. I can serve up the same plates at home with minimal cost. I know the restaurant needs to earn money for cooking, serving, paying wages, and renting the space.

We were the only table that night. The wait service was ordinary... between a bus boy and minimalist. The ambient was plain... and not a place you expect to pay $40 for two (before Groupon).

So diners, I enjoy a chance to have a different cultural experience. You should give it a try. Due to a lack of familiarity, the foods tasted bland and boring. I don't feel like gaining any new knowledge except a few words on the foods. I feel like they were serving home cooked meals or peasant foods as ambrosia and they charged accordingly. That's my problem with this restaurant. And I have a totally different experience than the Yelpers here.",review,aJGbFSkf6zCBbadpcD5uow,0,1,0

i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $5 and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo.

I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;
One, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!
On another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me ""a very inhumane person"" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).
Between the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.

Thought I was off to a good start getting new glasses.  I picked out my frames while I waited to be taken care of.  

Oh...wait...the eye glass gods had something else in store for me.  

The person helping me couldn't get an authorization code from my insurance company because it was afterhours.  He actually told me I had to pay full price or come back tomorrow.  Now keep in mind that I have had this insurance forever, never had any problems before; after hours, weekends, etc.  So I used my cell and called the insurance company.  I get someone on the phone who is trying to help us.  I put eyemaster guy on the phone and he actually got into a fight with the woman on the phone, handed it back to me and said here you talk to her, I'm done.  

So the lady got me the authorization code and a explaination that this doesn't happen because most eye glass providers can take care of everything in spite of the insurance company being closed and she also asked me if I was sure I shouldn't switch eyemaster locations due to this guys behavior.  

But I thought I was done.  I have my glasses picked out and I needed them to drive.  So while she was talking to me the guy at eyemasters was throwing out insults loud enough that the lady could hear.

It's like it's trying to be Binkley's, and it's not even in the same ballpark.

We were there on a THU night, and the place was dead.  Still, it seemed to take 30 minutes between courses.  Which is fine, if you have some bread or amuse bouche between.  Which you don't at Posh.  So, you eat your tasting portion in 4 minutes, then you sit there for another 26.  By the time the 3rd course came of our 5th course meal at hour one and a half, we were all tired, bored, and no longer hungry.  We ended up asking our last course to be wrapped, as we were that turned off.

What really disturbed me on the food, however, was the foie gras.  An extra $15 supplement - which is fine, as I think it's always worth it for great foie gras.  We were presented a plate with nice size piece of foie gras, in a fruit coulis, and what looked like a nice brulee crust on one side.  It looked amazing.  And was, if I stopped at eye appeal.  Unfortunately, Chef decided to go way off the grid, and serve it COLD.  I'm not talking room temp, I'm talking refrigerator cold.  If you are a foie gras fan, then you know this is like eating a square of lard.  It was impalitable.  Imagine being served a lump of shortening on a plate, because this is what cold foie gras tastes like.  

I like the surprise aspect of the courses, and I like the fact you can tell them what you like and don't like to start, but ultimately, I see now why it's best to know exactly what you're getting in advance.  

It took me about 10 minutes to figure out why the whole concept of Posh fails.  The dining experience starts when you're wowed by a menu, and sit in anticipation of what you've ordered.  When you have no expectations, it's hard to get excited.  By the time the plate is dropped and the server is telling you how your fluke is in a mascerated lima bean sauce with a marigold flower garnish and buttermilk glaze, you're not really into the ingredients, and just want to eat.  I had to ask my server to repeat every course I was served at least twice - lol.

Perhaps if I hadn't been spoiled by Binkley's, that has an expansive menu that changes daily, and you pick from 4-7 courses BUT you are given about 6-8 amuse bouche (and bread which is served French style with choices) between courses, I suppose I would have been more impressed with Posh.

So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.

The grounds were okay - NOT 5 star quality.  The decor in the rooms seemed old, and the color scheme was dated. 

Although most of the staff was friendly, we did have a pretty bad encounter with the pool manager.  My husband and I had bought a bag of popcorn at the grocery store and were snacking on it poolside.  The pool manager came up to us and informed us that outside food is not allowed in the pool area.  She told us that we needed to put our food away.  She then left without even offering the opportunity to order some Fairmont approved food.  It was really strange and off-putting.  We had been sitting by the pool for over an hour and not a single person from the wait staff had come up to us to take our drink/food orders.  Also, it seems a bit ridiculous that we can't eat our own bagged popcorn.  It's not like we were chowing down on a big meal and making a mess.  It made the resort seem elitist.  I definitely won't be staying here again.

The reason I gave it 2 stars is because the burger was very good and it was made the way I asked for it. My husbands burger was not.

But, the server and the fries left a lot to be desired. Let me preface by saying that we had been to several other locations. I like my fries crispy. I ask for them well done, extra crispy, scorched, tortured hollow tubes. Whatever their buzz word is for well done. The location will comply. EVERY OTHER 5 GUYS HAS COMPLIED. But not the one at TATUM AND SHEA. She said that corporate said they are not to cook the fries that way. So if we were to put up with soggy fries - yes soggy, then we did not want them. 

She also interrupted us several times which is rude. THEN she went and called corporate just to double check for us and she came to the table and said they said no they were not to cook them that way. Seriously? We did not ask for her to do this. She actually accused us of being undercover shoppers. We started to say something and then again- she interupted.

Listen, if you explain that our choice is not how the company wishes to present their product and we still choose to have them a different way, you should comply. It is after all our money and our decision. I was raised with the rules that #1 the customer is always right. And #2 if the customer is wrong REFER TO RULE NUMBER 1!!

  Pete's fish is ok, square, almost like processed but not. Strange but tasty. Chips are decent, taste like typical Ore-Ida frozen fries. The Onion rings were good (super greasy though). My biggest problem is that I am a bit of a traditionalist. If you are gonna call it ""fish and chips"" like they would in the UK, then you have to at least have malt vinegar. The red sauce is good with their fries and rings (and maybe shrimp) but not on fish. It is the only sauce they have. I hear the burgers are good and may go back, if I am already in the area, to try one. I wonder if they have mustard? They may be trying to do too many things at once here. Seafood, Americana, Mexican, (fish, shrimp, burritos, hot dogs, chicken, oysters) Just a thought.
  The seating is outside, if its summer you must get it to go. Between the heat, pigeons and huge flies (serious kitchen hawks) you will not have a good time.

Not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sitting on the table and asked me if I had wanted anything from the bar- she had to have noticed the mess?!
I ordered a $9.50 spider roll (soft-shelled crab), a $10 veggie tempura app, and a $19 baked lobster roll, all priced at 50% for one week during their 1-year anniversary.  They're all good, and factoring in the ostentatious surroundings, I'd pay $9.50 for the soft-shelled crab roll, but I'd put my foot down on the other two.  50% maybe, but $19 for a five-piece lobster roll?

It's like my brain has one of those little electric dog collar things attached to it, and when I start to stray too far east, it gives me a subliminal zap so I erase Mesa from the map in my mind.

So naturally, Stray Cats is usually a place I visit when meeting up with others who have suggested it. 

Thing is, I always end up having a pretty good time when I go there. The drinks are priced reasonably and generally on the strong side, the bartenders are friendly and quick to serve. The music is pretty good, but I've never been here when a DJ's spinning. I used to like the fact that there was an air conditioned smoking room off to the side with plush couches and big televisions. The crowd is always diverse, friendly and easy to engage in slurred conversation.

It just doesn't have any special oomph for me. I'd much rather frequent Hollywood Alley a couple miles south, where there's pool and live music.

I couldn't find much to like about my chicken tacos- they were ok, but the meat didn't have much flavor, there was no cheese, and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico. What really got me was that they didn't come with rice and beans. Instead, I got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesar-ish dressing. Sure, there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice (A slice!) on top, but come on. $14 for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine? For that much, they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad. Or, I dunno, sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos?

The story was much the same with the fish tacos, only the salad was different. The enchiladas seemed to be a hit, and those are served with rice and beans. the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal, and they aren't kidding about it being a side. I think my cat's food bowl is bigger. 

They charge $1 per bowl if you want more chips. I know $1 isn't a big deal, but it's just the principle. I already felt ripped off from the entree, so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse.

If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?  Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.

I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean, I wasn't expecting much coming into this place, I shouldn't have expected anything here.

I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So, I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee, plain, simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain. There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.

Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu.

The staff had great smiles, yet lacked follow through. We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice. The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen! Although poor in quality, they were high in price for what they serve. I'm not sure about the names of some of their rolls...one was named ""Climax."" Gross and just distasteful.  

The decor and ambiance leave you wanting. They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming.

The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but no-one came near us. We don't look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating.

I wasn't impressed for a number of reasons.  First, even after the discount the rate was $124.00 which included an $8.00 (normally $30.00) ""resort fee"" which included things that any other cheaper hotel/motel would offer for free like local calls. Second, for the price I would expect modern things, like maybe a FLAT SCREEN T.V.! Come on, they've been around for what, 10 years now? And a high dollar place like this can't afford one? Another annoyance was the fact that their high speed internet access costs $15.99 a day. I can get free high speed internet at any motel/hotel for less that $50.00 a night. Other annoyances include a t.v. remote that didn't work, and a shower head that was so loose that it almost came off when I tried to adjust it.

It seems like everybody that gives this transit system a good rating is a Phoenix native.  That makes this, like so many other things, good for Phoenix.  The problem is that it's terrible compared to nearly every other metro system in North America and absolutely abysmal compared to more progressive parts of the world.

This is quite possible the slowest train that I have ever ridden in my life.  It seems to make stops every two blocks and it take far too long to get anywhere.  Factor in the terrible hours of operation and you're going to easily find yourself stranded at one end or the other after a night at the bar.

You can only like this place if you don't know anything about Vietnamese food. 

What I tried...

Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?  You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.  

Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?

Service stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc.

Vegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown. 

If you can't cook something why even bother serving it to customers.  I don't know about other entrees they offer but I won't be coming back to find out.

When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.

Nowhere to park, forced to valet, meh...

Love the atmosphere here: classy decor, beautiful patio. Everything on the menu looked delicious. I had a hard time choosing between many foods that I love: crab cakes, goat cheese, crepes... I wanted something lighter so I ordered the oriental chicken salad. In the meantime, our drinks were brought to the table. BFF pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it. The question is: who left it there? Don't know. Gross. This was pointed out to a server (not ours because she had not returned to our table). Our server brought out a new iced tea. She was polite, but not necessarily apologetic. 

When our meal was delivered to the table, BFF pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich (she asked for no tomatoes). The server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate. She came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out. So, I sat with my salad and waited to eat until BFF got her meal (It took a good 5-10 minutes for her new sandwich to come out). 

BFF raved about the dressing on her side salad. My salad was fine, but nothing to rave about (especially not for $13). The ingredients were fresh but the ""shredded chicken"" that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast. To be honest, I prefer shredded chicken which is why I had decided on that particular salad. DISAPPOINTING.

The server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert. We replied, ""no, thank you"". And she said something like, ""oh, come on, are you sure?"". Again, we declined but I really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch.

The topper? 1 valet guy and 6 people in line to pick up their cars=a 10 minute wait just to leave the place.
